# Home Page Links - Complete Audit & Implementation

## üéØ What Was Done

### Problem Statement
The home page and footer had 40+ placeholder links (`href="#"`) that did nothing, breaking the immersive experience of the RetailFlow simulation.

### Solution Implemented
Created an **Education Modal System** that intercepts clicks on educational links and displays contextual information about what would happen in a real e-commerce scenario.

## üìä Home Page Link Status

### Main Navigation Cards (3 Links)

#### 1. "Start Shopping" Button
- **Before**: `href="#"` - did nothing
- **After**: `data-education="shopping"` - Shows modal explaining browsing products
- **Message**: "In a real e-commerce site, you would browse and purchase products here..."

#### 2. "Track Order" Button  
- **Before**: `href="#"` - did nothing
- **After**: `data-education="track-order"` - Shows modal explaining order tracking
- **Message**: "Enter your order number here to track your package in real-time..."

#### 3. "View Careers" Button
- **Before**: `href="#"` - did nothing
- **After**: `data-education="careers"` - Shows modal explaining job application process
- **Message**: "Browse job positions and apply for careers at RetailFlow..."

## üîß How The System Works

### User Experience Flow

```

```

**Header**: Light blue background with info icon

## üöÄ How to Use

To add a new educational link:

The `data-education` value (e.g., "shopping") matches a key in the `educationMessages` object in `js/education-modal.js`.
