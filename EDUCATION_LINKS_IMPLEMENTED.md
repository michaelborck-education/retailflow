# Education Modal System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

All placeholder links (`href="#"`) on the RetailFlow site now use an **Education Modal System** that displays contextual information about what would happen in a real e-commerce scenario.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Education Modal JavaScript (`js/education-modal.js`)

A reusable modal system that:
- Shows contextual educational messages for simulated features
- Uses Bootstrap 5 modals for professional appearance
- Provides clear messaging about the fictional nature of RetailFlow
- Can be applied to any link with `data-education="[type]"` attribute

### 2. Updated Home Page (`index.html`)

All placeholder links now have `data-education` attributes:

#### Main Content Cards
| Link | Type | Message |
|------|------|---------|
| Start Shopping | `shopping` | "Browse and purchase products here" |
| Track Order | `track-order` | "Enter order number to track shipment" |
| View Careers | `careers` | "Browse job positions and apply" |

#### Footer - Shop Section
| Link | Type |
|------|------|
| New Arrivals | `shopping` |
| Best Sellers | `shopping` |
| Sale Items | `shopping` |
| Gift Cards | `gift-cards` |

#### Footer - Customer Service
| Link | Type |
|------|------|
| Shipping Info | `shipping` |
| Returns | `returns` |
| FAQ | `faq` |

#### Footer - About
| Link | Type |
|------|------|
| Careers | `careers` |
| Press | `press` |

#### Footer - Legal
| Link | Type |
|------|------|
| Privacy Policy | `privacy` |
| Terms of Service | `terms` |

#### Social Media
| Link | Type |
|------|------|
| Facebook | `social` |
| Twitter | `social` |
| Instagram | `social` |
| LinkedIn | `social` |

## How It Works

### User Clicks a Link
```
User clicks "Start Shopping" button
↓
Browser triggers education-modal.js click handler
↓
showEducationModal('shopping') is called
↓
Modal appears with custom message
↓
User understands this is a simulation feature
```

### Example Modal

When user clicks "Start Shopping":

**Modal Content:**
- Title: "Shopping Feature"
- Message: "In a real e-commerce site, you would browse and purchase products here. This is an educational simulation, so no actual purchases can be made."
- Action: "Browse Products"
- Footer: "This is a fictional RetailFlow simulation for educational purposes."

    link.addEventListener('click', function(e) {

});
```
