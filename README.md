# RetailFlow - Educational Simulation

RetailFlow is a fictional company created for educational purposes to teach AI project management through an immersive simulation experience.

## About This Project

This is a **static website** built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages. It simulates a real e-commerce company website while providing educational content about AI project management.

## Features

### Public-Facing Pages

## Key Design Decisions

### Why HTML/CSS/JS instead of Quarto?
- **Interactive Forms**: Quarto treats HTML as code blocks, breaking contact forms
- **Better Control**: Direct control over DOM manipulation and user interactions
- **Simpler Hosting**: No build process required for GitHub Pages
- **Performance**: Faster load times with no static site generation overhead

### Simulation Features
- **Contact Form**: Shows educational message when submitted
- **Professional Appearance**: Looks like a real e-commerce site
- **Clear Disclosure**: Educational purpose is clearly stated
- **Learning Objectives**: Each interaction teaches specific concepts

This site is designed for GitHub Pages deployment:

1. Push to a GitHub repository
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings

4. Choose main branch and / (root) folder
