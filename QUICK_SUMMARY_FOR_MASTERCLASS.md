# Quick Summary: Is the Website Ready for Masterclass?

## The Answer: **70% Ready** ✅✅⏳

### What's Working Perfectly ✅

1. **Company Context Pages** - Excellent
   - Company overview, team profiles, financial metrics
   - Helps participants understand RetailFlow
   - Perfect for building immersion

2. **Project Information** - Excellent
   - Charter, timeline, budget, success metrics
   - Gives clear picture of AI chatbot pilot
   - Supports morning discussions

3. **Educational Framing** - Excellent
   - Clear disclaimers and educational purpose
   - Professional appearance
   - Good support for context-building

### What's Missing ❌

The course features **4 crisis management scenarios** that are central to the afternoon activities:
1. Data Quality Crisis
2. Staff Resistance Crisis  
3. Executive Pressure Crisis
4. Ethical Dilemma Crisis

These currently exist only in PDF handouts. **For projection and live discussion, need HTML pages.**

Also missing: **Scale/Kill decisions case study page**

### The Gap Impact

**Without these pages:**
- ❌ Facilitator must print 100+ pages of scenarios
- ❌ Can't project scenarios to projector
- ❌ Harder to manage group discussion
- ❌ Less engaging for participants

**With these pages:**
- ✅ Clean, professional presentation
- ✅ Can project on screen for whole group
- ✅ Better engagement
- ✅ Easier facilitation

### What to Do

#### **Option A: Minimum** (Run as-is)
- Course works fine
- Use printed handouts for scenarios
- Less ideal but functional

#### **Option B: Recommended** (4-6 hours work)
Add these pages:
- `/crisis/crisis-1-data-quality.html`
- `/crisis/crisis-2-staff-resistance.html`
- `/crisis/crisis-3-executive-pressure.html`
- `/crisis/crisis-4-ethical-dilemma.html`
- `/decisions/scale-or-kill-cases.html`

**Result:** Professional, integrated tool. Significantly better facilitation.

#### **Option C: Ideal** (6-8 hours work)
Add everything from Option B, plus:
- `/facilitator/dashboard.html` - Timer, decision tracking, results
- Facilitator quick reference guide

**Result:** World-class facilitation experience. Website becomes core teaching tool.

### Time Investment

| Option | Time | Complexity | Benefit |
|--------|------|-----------|---------|
| A (As-is) | 0h | Low | ✅ Functional |
| B (Recommended) | 4-6h | Low-Medium | ✅✅ Good |
| C (Ideal) | 6-8h | Medium | ✅✅✅ Excellent |

### My Recommendation

**Go with Option B (Recommended)** - 4-6 hours of work

**Why:**
- Adds significant value (4-6 hours for professional improvement)
- Low complexity (mostly copying content from handouts to HTML)
- High impact (transforms facilitation experience)
- Reusable for future masterclasses
- Cost/benefit ratio excellent

**Action Plan:**
1. Allocate 4-6 hours before masterclass
2. Create the 5 HTML pages from handout content
3. Test on projector
4. Provide facilitator with URL reference
5. Run masterclass with integrated website
