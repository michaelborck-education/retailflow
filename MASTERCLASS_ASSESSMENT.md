## Gap Analysis - What's Missing

### ‚ùå **CRITICAL GAPS** (Must Add for Full Course Experience)

#### 1. **Crisis Scenario Pages** (MISSING)
The course features 4 detailed crisis scenarios:
- **Crisis 1:** Data Quality Disaster (bad data from chatbot)
- **Crisis 2:** Staff Resistance (frontline revolt)
- **Crisis 3:** Executive Pressure (budget/timeline crisis)
- **Crisis 4:** Ethical Dilemma (chatbot discriminates)

**Current State:** Scenarios exist only in PDF handouts
**Need:** Interactive pages where facilitator can display crisis scenarios to participants

**Impact:** Without this, facilitator must:
- Print 25 scenarios (5 copies √ó 5 groups)
- Hand them out manually
- Manage paper flow
- Hard to share live with projector

**Suggested Pages:**
- `crisis/crisis-1-data-quality.html`
- `crisis/crisis-2-staff-resistance.html`
- `crisis/crisis-3-executive-pressure.html`
- `crisis/crisis-4-ethical-dilemma.html`

#### 2. **Crisis Response Tracking** (MISSING)
Facilitator needs a way to:
- Display crisis scenario on screen
- Track group decisions
- Show timer for each crisis
- Display stakeholder responses to decisions

**Current State:** Manual facilitation with printed materials
**Need:** Live interface showing crises and responses

**Suggested Pages:**
- `facilitator/crisis-management-interface.html` (for facilitator only)

#### 3. **Scale/Kill Decision Interface** (MISSING)
The afternoon session requires analyzing 3 AI projects and making Scale/Kill/Pivot decisions.

**Current State:** Only exists in handout documents
**Need:** Interactive cases that can be discussed and displayed

**Suggested Pages:**
- `decisions/scale-or-kill-cases.html` - Displays all 3 cases

Create 4 HTML pages, one for each crisis scenario

**Pages to Create:**
1. `crisis/crisis-1-data-quality.html`
   - Displays the data quality crisis scenario
   - Shows conversation logs
   - Lists what participants need to decide

   - Financial constraints

4. `crisis/crisis-4-ethical-dilemma.html`
   - Chatbot discrimination issue
   - Affected customer groups
   - Business impact vs. ethical concerns
   - Decision framework

**Content:** Convert existing markdown handouts to interactive HTML pages

**Time Estimate:** 3-4 hours

**Benefit:** Facilitator can project live, group discussion becomes more engaging, reduces paper waste

---

### **PRIORITY 2: Scale/Kill Decisions Page** (MEDIUM IMPACT, Low Effort)

**Why:** Afternoon exercise where groups analyze 3 AI projects and make strategic recommendations

**Pages to Create:**
1. `decisions/scale-or-kill-cases.html`
   - Displays all 3 decision cases
   - Shows metrics, constraints, and outcomes
   - Helps groups analyze and decide

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours

**Benefit:** Can project cases to room, supports group discussion, cleaner than paper

---

### **PRIORITY 3: Facilitator Dashboard** (NICE-TO-HAVE, High Effort)

**Why:** Advanced feature for tracking live responses and comparing group decisions

**Pages to Create:**
1. `facilitator/dashboard.html`
   - Timer for each crisis (5-10 minute countdown)
   - Decision input form for each group
   - Results comparison view
   - Facilitator notes template

**Time Estimate:** 4-6 hours

**Benefit:** Professional facilitation experience, live engagement metric, outcome comparison

## Financial Impact Assessment

### Facilitation Challenges Without New Pages

**Printing Costs:**

- More work for facilitator (manage paper)

### Benefits of Adding Pages

**Efficiency:**
- 0 printing costs for crisis scenarios
- Real-time projection
- Live decision tracking
- Professional facilitation experience

**Engagement:**
- Participants see scenarios projected
- Real-time results comparison
- Digital-first experience
- More interactive

**Reusability:**
- Pages can be used for future masterclasses

## Final Recommendation

### **VERDICT: Website is 70% Ready**

#### For Minimum Viable Course (As-Is):
‚úÖ Can run the masterclass
‚úÖ Company context exists
‚úÖ Project information available
‚ö†Ô∏è Will require heavy printing and manual facilitation

#### To Reach 95% Readiness (Recommended):
Add 2-4 hours of work:
- Crisis scenario pages
- Scale/Kill decisions page
- Optional: Facilitator dashboard

#### To Reach 100% Readiness (Ideal):
Add 6-8 hours of work:
- All above pages
- Facilitator dashboard with timers
- Decision tracking interface
- Results comparison view

---

## Specific Pages Needed

### **Immediate (Must-Have for Great Course)**

```
/crisis/
  - crisis-1-data-quality.html
  - crisis-2-staff-resistance.html
  - crisis-3-executive-pressure.html
  - crisis-4-ethical-dilemma.html
  
/decisions/
  - scale-or-kill-cases.html
```

### **Enhancement (Nice-to-Have for Excellent Course)**

```
/facilitator/
  - dashboard.html (timer + decision tracking)
  - facilitator-notes.html (quick reference)
```

---

## Conclusion

**The website provides excellent support for pre-masterclass learning and company context**, but is missing **key interactive pages for the afternoon crisis management simulation**.

**Recommended Action:** Invest 4-6 hours to add the crisis scenario pages and scale/kill decisions page. This will transform the website from a "nice-to-have" resource into a **core facilitation tool** that enhances the masterclass experience significantly.

**Without these pages:** Course can still run successfully (scenarios are in handouts), but facilitation is less smooth and engagement could be higher.

**With these pages:** Website becomes an integral part of the course, improving facilitation efficiency, participant engagement, and professional delivery.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Decide on investment level (Minimum, Recommended, or Ideal)
2. Allocate 4-8 hours for development
3. Test pages with projector before masterclass
4. Provide facilitator with quick reference guide
5. Brief facilitators on using website during exercises
