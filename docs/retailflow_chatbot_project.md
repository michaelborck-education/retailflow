- Customer history (purchase frequency, average spend)
- Previous interactions with customer service
- Current issues/open tickets
- Communication preferences

**Order Data:**
- Order ID, date, status
- Items ordered (SKU, quantity, price)

- Escalation paths

### Data Quality Challenges Identified

**Issue 1: Inconsistent Customer Records**
- Duplicates in Salesforce CRM
- Inconsistent phone numbers, email formats
- Mitigation: Data cleansing process in Phase 1

**Issue 2: Incomplete Order History**
- Some orders missing tracking information
- Status updates incomplete for older orders
- Mitigation: Load complete order dataset; accept some older orders may have gaps
