---

### **SECTION 2: THE AI PROJECT CHALLENGE (15 minutes)**

---

#### **Slide 6: The Brutal Truth About AI Projects**

**Big bold statistic in center:**

# 80%
**of AI projects fail to deliver value**

**Source:** Gartner, 2023

**Speaker Notes:**
- "Let that sink in"
- "4 out of 5 AI projects fail"
- "Not because the technology doesn't work..."

---

#### **Slide 7: Why AI Projects Fail**

**Pie chart or icon breakdown:**

**Technical Issues: 20%**
- Algorithm doesn't work
- Data quality problems
- Infrastructure failures

**People & Organizational Issues: 80%**
- Stakeholder resistance
- Unclear objectives
- Poor change management
- Ethical oversights
- Wrong metrics
- Scope creep

**Speaker Notes:**
- "This is the most important slide of the day"
- "AI project leadership is NOT primarily about technology"
- "It's about people, politics, and change"
- "That's what we're focusing on today"

---

#### **Slide 8: Real AI Project Failures**

**Three brief case examples (icons + text):**

**üè• Healthcare AI Diagnostic Tool**
- $5M investment, 2-year development
- 95% accuracy in lab testing
- **FAILED:** Clinicians didn't trust it, refused to use it
- Lesson: Forgot about user adoption

**üè™ Retail Inventory AI**
- Reduced stockouts by 40% (success!)
- **FAILED:** Automated away jobs, union backlash, PR disaster
- Lesson: Didn't manage people impact

**üí∞ Bank Loan Approval AI**
- Improved processing speed by 70%
- **FAILED:** Discriminated against protected groups
- Lesson: Ethical oversight missing

**Speaker Notes:**
- "These are real projects (anonymized)"
- "All had solid technology"
- "All failed because of people and process issues"
- "Today you'll practice navigating exactly these challenges"

---

#### **Slide 9: Traditional Projects vs. AI Projects**

**Two-column comparison table:**

| **Traditional Project** | **AI Project** |
|------------------------|---------------|
| Requirements known upfront | Requirements emerge through experimentation |
| Linear progression | Iterative, hypothesis-driven |
| Success criteria clear | Success criteria evolve |
| Predictable timeline | "We'll know more after the pilot" |
| Technical risk primary | Organizational risk dominant |
| Implementation focus | Learning & adaptation focus |
| Gantt charts rule | Experiments rule |

**Speaker Notes:**
- "Many of you have led successful traditional projects"
- "AI projects require DIFFERENT skills"
- "Not better or worse - different"
- "Today we focus on what's unique about AI"

---

#### **Slide 10: The AI Project Lifecycle**

**Visual diagram - circular or linear flow:**

```
IDEATION ‚Üí SCOPING ‚Üí PILOT ‚Üí EVALUATION ‚Üí DECISION
                                               ‚Üì
                                    SCALE / PIVOT / KILL
```

**Each phase highlighted:**
- **Ideation:** Identify opportunity
- **Scoping:** Define pilot boundaries
- **Pilot:** Build and test at small scale
- **Evaluation:** Measure results rigorously
- **Decision:** Scale, Pivot, or Kill

**Speaker Notes:**
- "Most organizations rush through Scoping"
- "Most fail at Evaluation (don't measure the right things)"
- "Most struggle with the Kill decision (sunk cost fallacy)"
- "Today you'll practice the hardest parts: Scoping, Crisis Management, and Scale/Kill decisions"

---

### **SECTION 3: PROJECT MANAGEMENT FUNDAMENTALS REFRESHER (15 minutes)**

*This section is primarily for students and non-PM professionals*

---

#### **Slide 11: Project Management Essentials**

**For those new to project management:**

**A project is:**
- Temporary endeavor
- Defined beginning and end
- Creates unique outcome
- Cross-functional team

**Project management is:**
- Planning, organizing, executing
- Managing constraints: Scope, Time, Budget, Quality
- Coordinating people and resources
- Delivering value

**Speaker Notes:**
- "Some of you are experienced PMs - bear with me for 10 minutes"
- "For students and specialists, here's a quick foundation"
- "AI projects use these fundamentals, but apply them differently"

---

#### **Slide 12: The Iron Triangle (Refresher)**

**Triangle diagram:**

```
         SCOPE
        /      \
       /        \
    TIME -------- COST
          |
       QUALITY
```

**Traditional PM:** Pick two - sacrifice the third

**AI Projects:** All four are variables, evolving targets

**Speaker Notes:**
- "Traditional projects: fixed scope, variable time/cost"
- "AI projects: everything is variable until pilot proves value"
- "This makes AI leadership harder"

---

#### **Slide 13: Key PM Concepts for AI Projects**

**Four boxes with icons:**

**üìã SCOPE MANAGEMENT**
- What's in, what's out
- For AI: Start narrow, prove value, then expand
- Common error: "Let's automate everything!"

**üë• STAKEHOLDER MANAGEMENT**
- Identify who cares, who has power
- For AI: More diverse stakeholders than traditional projects
- Critical success factor

**‚ö†Ô∏è RISK MANAGEMENT**
- What could go wrong?
- For AI: New risk categories (bias, ethics, trust)
- Must plan for unknowns

**üîÑ CHANGE MANAGEMENT**
- How do people adapt?
- For AI: Biggest determinant of success/failure
- Can't be an afterthought

**Speaker Notes:**
- "We'll practice all four today"
- "Especially stakeholder and change management"
- "Because that's where AI projects live or die"

---

#### **Slide 14: The AI Project Team**

**Org chart or role diagram:**

**Core Roles:**
- **Executive Sponsor** (provides air cover, budget, strategy)
- **Project Manager** (YOU - orchestrates everything)
- **Data Scientist / AI Engineer** (builds the model)
- **Business Owner** (owns the problem, defines success)
- **IT/Infrastructure** (systems, security, integration)
- **End Users** (will use the AI, need to adopt it)

**Critical insight:** All these people have different:
- Languages (technical vs. business)
- Priorities (speed vs. quality vs. cost)
- Fears (job loss, failure, being blamed)
- Metrics (what "success" means)

**YOUR JOB:** Align them all

**Speaker Notes:**
- "Notice: More diverse than traditional project teams"
- "You're translating between worlds"
- "Data scientist speaks Python, exec speaks ROI, end user speaks 'Will I get fired?'"
- "This is why stakeholder management is critical"

---

### **SECTION 4: THE "HUMANS IN THE LOOP" FRAMEWORK (20 minutes)**

*This is YOUR signature framework - make it yours*

---

#### **Slide 15: Introducing "Humans in the Loop"**

**Title:** Beyond the Technology: Humans in the Loop

**Subtitle:** The Leadership Framework for AI Project Success

**Visual:** Diagram showing AI technology surrounded by humans (stakeholders, users, leaders)

**The Core Principle:**
"AI projects aren't about replacing humans with technology.  
They're about designing new ways for humans and AI to work together."

**Speaker Notes:**
- "This is the framework we'll use throughout today"
- "It has three pillars: Stakeholder Orchestration, Change Navigation, Ethical Leadership"
- "These aren't fluffy - they're mission-critical"

---

#### **Slide 16: Pillar 1 - Stakeholder Orchestration**

**Visual:** Multiple stakeholder icons with connecting lines

**The Challenge:**
Every AI project has 6-10 key stakeholders with conflicting interests

**Your Job:**
- Identify all stakeholders (including hidden ones)
- Understand their motivations (stated vs. actual)
- Map their power and interest
- Develop engagement strategies
- Build coalitions

**Common Stakeholders in AI Projects:**
- Executive Sponsor (wants glory, fears failure)
- Finance (wants ROI, fears cost overruns)
- IT Security (wants safety, fears breaches)
- End Users (fear job loss, want ease)
- Operations (wants stability, fears disruption)
- Data Scientists (want cutting-edge, fear technical debt)

**Speaker Notes:**
- "Notice: Every stakeholder has fears"
- "Your job is to understand and address those fears"
- "At 11am, you'll BECOME these stakeholders in a role-play"
- "You'll experience their perspectives firsthand"

---

#### **Slide 17: Stakeholder Power-Interest Matrix**

**2x2 Matrix diagram:**

```
         HIGH POWER
              |
    KEEP      |      MANAGE
  SATISFIED   |      CLOSELY
              |
--------------+-------------- HIGH INTEREST
              |
   MONITOR    |       KEEP
              |     INFORMED
              |
         LOW POWER
```

**Strategies for each quadrant:**
- **Manage Closely:** Frequent engagement, decision rights
- **Keep Satisfied:** Regular updates, address concerns
- **Keep Informed:** Transparent communication
- **Monitor:** Minimal effort, but stay aware

**Speaker Notes:**
- "This is PM 101, but it's critical for AI"
- "AI projects have more stakeholders in 'Manage Closely' than traditional projects"
- "Because AI touches more parts of the organization"
- "And because fear and uncertainty are higher"

---

#### **Slide 18: Pillar 2 - Change Navigation**

**Visual:** Journey/path metaphor with obstacles

**The Reality:**
AI changes how people work. Change creates resistance. Resistance kills projects.

**Change Management Essentials:**

**1. Expect Resistance** (it's normal, not personal)
- Fear of job loss
- Fear of failure
- Fear of being replaced
- Comfort with status quo

**2. Involve Early** (people support what they create)
- Include end users in design
- Solicit feedback genuinely
- Give them ownership

**3. Communicate Constantly** (overcommunicate)
- What's changing, why, when
- What's NOT changing
- How it affects them personally

**4. Train & Support** (reduce fear through competence)
- Hands-on training
- Safe practice environments
- Ongoing support

**Speaker Notes:**
- "This afternoon, you'll face a crisis of team resistance"
- "You'll practice having difficult conversations"
- "You'll learn how costly it is to skip change management"

---

#### **Slide 19: The Change Curve**

**Visual:** Emotional journey graph

```

1.Denial          3.Exploration
    |__________________|____________‚Üí Time
```

**Stages:**
1. **Denial:** "This won't affect me" / "AI won't work here"
2. **Resistance:** "I don't want this" / Active pushback
3. **Exploration:** "Maybe this could work" / Testing
4. **Commitment:** "This is how we work now" / Adoption

**Your Job:** Help people move through stages faster

**Speaker Notes:**
- "People don't go from Denial to Commitment instantly"
- "Trying to force it creates more resistance"
- "You have to meet people where they are"

---

#### **Slide 20: Pillar 3 - Ethical Leadership**

**Visual:** Compass or scales of justice

**Why Ethics Matter in AI Projects:**
- AI can perpetuate bias (hiring, lending, healthcare)
- AI can invade privacy (surveillance, data collection)
- AI can eliminate jobs (automation, efficiency)
- AI decisions can be opaque ("black box" problem)

**Your Responsibility as Project Leader:**
- Ask uncomfortable questions
- Surface ethical concerns early
- Don't hide behind "it's just technical"
- Sometimes the right decision is to KILL a project

**Speaker Notes:**
- "This afternoon, you'll face an ethical dilemma"
- "Your AI will be working, delivering ROI"
- "But it will be providing worse service to certain groups"
- "What do you do?"
- "There's no perfect answer, but there IS a leadership responsibility"

---

#### **Slide 21: The Ethics Framework for AI Projects**

**Four key questions to ask repeatedly:**

**1. WHO benefits from this AI?**
   - Who wins? Who loses?
   - Are benefits distributed fairly?

**2. WHAT could go wrong?**
   - Bias, discrimination, privacy, safety
   - What's the worst-case scenario?

**3. HOW do we know it's working?**
   - What are we measuring?
   - Are we measuring the right things?

**4. WHEN do we stop?**
   - What would make us kill this project?
   - What's our red line?

**Speaker Notes:**
- "These aren't questions you ask once"
- "You ask them at every stage"
- "Ideation, scoping, pilot, evaluation, scaling"

---

## BACKUP SLIDES (Optional - Use if time or if questions arise)

---

#### **Backup Slide 1: PM Methodologies for AI**

**Common Approaches:**

**Waterfall:** ‚ùå Too rigid for AI (requirements change)  
**Agile/Scrum:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Better, but sprints may not align with model training  
**Lean Startup:** ‚úì Build-Measure-Learn fits AI well  
**Experimental:** ‚úì Hypothesis-driven, embrace uncertainty

**Best Practice:** Hybrid approach
- Waterfall for infrastructure/integration
- Agile for feature development
- Experimental for model development

---

#### **Backup Slide 2: Success Metrics for AI Projects**

**Don't just measure technical metrics:**

**Technical Metrics** (necessary but insufficient):
- Model accuracy, precision, recall
- System uptime
- Response time

**Business Metrics** (what sponsors care about):
- Cost savings
- Revenue increase
- Time savings
- Customer satisfaction

**Adoption Metrics** (often forgotten):
- User adoption rate
- Override frequency
- User satisfaction
- Retention

**Measure all three or you'll miss important signals**

---

#### **Backup Slide 3: When to Kill an AI Project**

**Red flags that suggest KILL decision:**

- Fundamental technical limitation (can't achieve needed accuracy)
- Ethical issues can't be resolved
- Organizational resistance is insurmountable
- Business case has evaporated
- Better solutions emerged
- Sunk cost fallacy is driving decisions

**Remember:** Killing a bad project is GOOD leadership
