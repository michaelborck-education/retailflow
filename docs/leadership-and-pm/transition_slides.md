# Exercise 1 {background-color="#003087"}

**Stakeholder Speed Dating**

11:00am - 11:45am

---

## Stakeholder Speed Dating

**Objective:** Experience AI project stakeholder perspectives firsthand

**What you'll do:**

1. Each person receives a **role card** (one of 6 stakeholders)
2. Read your role card carefully (3 minutes)
3. Have **5-minute conversations** with different stakeholders
4. Stay in character - embrace their fears and motivations
5. Take notes in your workbook

**Materials:** Role cards will be distributed now

::: {.notes}
**FACILITATOR ACTIONS:**
- Distribute role cards (one per person, mixed across tables)
- Give 3 minutes to read role cards
- Explain: "You'll rotate conversations every 5 minutes when I ring the bell"
- "Stay in character - experience their perspective, not your own"
- "The point is to understand WHY stakeholders resist or support AI"
- Set timer, ring bell every 5 minutes for rotations
- After 25 minutes, stop and debrief as full group
:::

---

## Stakeholder Debrief

**After the exercise, discuss:**

- Which stakeholder surprised you most?
- What hidden motivations did you discover?
- Which stakeholder would be your biggest ally? Biggest obstacle?
- How would you manage these competing interests?

**Now map your stakeholders on the Power-Interest Matrix in your workbook**

::: {.notes}
- Give groups 10 minutes for this debrief
- Walk around and listen to their insights
- Ask probing questions: "Why do you think the IT Security person was so resistant?"
- After 10 minutes, ask 2-3 groups to share one key insight with the room
- Connect back to morning framework: "This is Pillar 1 - Stakeholder Orchestration"
- Transition: "Now you understand the stakeholders. Let's design an AI project..."

# Exercise 2 {background-color="#003087"}

**Scoping the AI Pilot**

11:45am - 12:30pm

---

## Pilot Scoping Exercise

**Objective:** Design a well-scoped AI pilot for RetailFlow

**The Challenge:**  
RetailFlow's customer service is broken (26-hour response times, 68% satisfaction)

**Your Task (30 minutes):**

1. Review the **RetailFlow case study** in your packet
2. Complete the **Pilot Scoping Worksheet** as a group
3. Define: Scope, metrics, risks, budget, timeline
4. Make it "Goldilocks perfect" - not too big, not too small

**Then... a surprise constraint will change everything**

::: {.notes}
**FACILITATOR ACTIONS:**
- "All materials are in your participant packet"
- "Turn to the Pilot Scoping section"
- "You have 30 minutes to complete the worksheet"
- "One person should be the scribe, but everyone contributes"
- Set 30-minute timer
- After 20 minutes: Give 10-minute warning
- After 30 minutes: Distribute ONE random constraint card per group
- "You now have 10 minutes to adapt your plan based on this constraint"
- After 10 minutes: Ask 2-3 groups to briefly share how they adapted
- Key learning: "No plan survives first contact with reality"
:::

---

## Pilot Scoping Debrief

**Quick shares (2 minutes each):**

- What constraint did your group receive?
- How did you adapt your pilot plan?
- What did you have to sacrifice?
- What was non-negotiable?

**Key Insight:** Flexibility and clear priorities are essential

::: {.notes}
- Ask 3-4 groups to share quickly
- Listen for:
  - Did they reduce scope or extend timeline?
  - What trade-offs did they make?
  - Did they think creatively or just cut things?
- Reinforce: "This is realistic - projects always face unexpected constraints"
- "Your ability to adapt while maintaining value is leadership"
- Check time - should be close to 12:30pm
- "Great work this morning. Let's break for lunch."
:::

# Exercise 3 {background-color="#003087"}

**Crisis Management Simulation**

1:15pm - 2:30pm

---

## Crisis Management Simulation {.smaller}

**The Scenario:**  
You're 2 months into the RetailFlow chatbot pilot. Week 2 of live deployment.

**You will face 4 crises in 75 minutes:**

1. **Crisis 1:** Data Quality Disaster (20 min)  
   *Technical failure - AI giving wrong answers*

2. **Crisis 2:** Staff Resistance (25 min)  
   *People problem - team actively sabotaging*

3. **Crisis 3:** Executive Pressure (25 min)  
   *Leadership challenge - sponsor demands acceleration*

4. **Crisis 4:** Ethical Dilemma (20 min)  
   *Values decision - AI works but discriminates*

**Work through each crisis sequentially in your groups**

::: {.notes}
**FACILITATOR ACTIONS:**
- "This is the centerpiece of the day"
- "You'll experience what AI project crises FEEL like"
- "Work through each crisis in your packet in order"
- "Some involve role-plays with me - I'll come to your table"
- "Diagnose, decide, communicate - under time pressure"
- "Let's begin with Crisis 1 - Data Quality Disaster"
- Set 20-minute timer
- Walk around, observe, don't intervene unless groups are stuck
- After 20 min: Brief debrief (5 min), then move to Crisis 2
:::

---

## Crisis 1: Data Quality {.smaller}

**20 minutes**

**The Problem:**  
AI chatbot accuracy dropped from 85% to 62% over the weekend. Customer service manager wants to shut it down immediately.

**Your Tasks:**

1. **Diagnose** - What's causing this? (look for patterns in the logs)
2. **Decide** - Shut down completely? Partial shutdown? Keep running?
3. **Communicate** - What do you tell stakeholders RIGHT NOW?
4. **Fix** - What's your 48-hour action plan?

**Begin now - you have 20 minutes**

::: {.notes}
- Set timer for 20 minutes
- Let groups work
- After 15 minutes, give 5-minute warning
- Watch for groups that jump to solutions without diagnosing
- After 20 minutes: Quick debrief
  - "What did you discover was the root cause?"
  - "Who chose to shut down? Who kept running? Why?"
  - Reveal: "In the real scenario, the return policy was updated Friday but training data wasn't"
- Key learning: "Diagnose before deciding. Pattern recognition matters."
- "Okay, Crisis 1 managed. But there's no rest..."
:::

---

## Crisis 2: Staff Resistance {.smaller}

**25 minutes**

**The Problem:**  
Customer service team is gaming the system - routing easy queries to themselves, sending impossible queries to the bot. Union involved.

**Your Tasks:**

1. **Phase 1 (10 min):** Role-play conversation with Sarah, the resistant team lead  
   *I will play Sarah at your table - have the difficult conversation*

2. **Phase 2 (10 min):** Develop change management strategy  
   *How do you rebuild trust? What changes to your approach?*

3. **Phase 3 (5 min):** Brief presentation of your strategy

**Groups 1 & 2: I'll come to you first for role-play**

::: {.notes}
**FACILITATOR ACTIONS:**
- "This is about change management - the people side"
- "I'll play Sarah, the resistant team lead, at each table"
- "Have the conversation with me - practice the difficult discussion"
- Rotate between tables (2-3 min per table for role-play)
- Use the Sarah script from crisis materials:
  - Start defensive
  - Test their empathy
  - Reveal real fears if they listen
  - Soften if genuine
- After role-plays done: "Now develop your change management strategy"
- 10 minutes for strategy development
- Ask 2 groups to share their approach (2 min each)
- Key learning: "Resistance is normal. Involvement and empathy matter."
:::

---

## Crisis 3: Executive Pressure {.smaller}

**25 minutes**

**The Problem:**  
Your executive sponsor wants to accelerate full rollout to ALL departments in 8 weeks (instead of 6-month pilot). Board is watching.

**Your Tasks:**

1. **Phase 1 (5 min):** Prepare your position  
   *What's your recommendation? What data supports it?*

2. **Phase 2 (10 min):** Role-play meeting with Executive Sponsor  
   *I will play the demanding sponsor - negotiate with me*

3. **Phase 3 (10 min):** Finalize your response and communication plan

**Groups 3 & 4: I'll start with you**

::: {.notes}
**FACILITATOR ACTIONS:**
- "This tests your ability to manage up"
- "Can you push back against senior leadership with data and reasoning?"
- Give groups 5 minutes to prepare position
- Then rotate for role-plays (3-4 min per table)
- Use Emma script from materials:
  - Be enthusiastic and persuasive
  - Apply career pressure subtly
  - Downplay technical concerns
  - Use competitive urgency
  - If they hold firm with good reasoning, listen
- After role-plays: 10 min to finalize response
- Debrief: "Who agreed to the timeline? Who pushed back? How did it feel?"
- Key learning: "Managing up requires courage and data, not just compliance"
:::

---

## Crisis 4: Ethical Dilemma {.smaller}

**20 minutes**

**The Problem:**  
Your AI works well overall (81% accuracy), but provides systematically worse service to customers who use informal language, slang, or non-native English.

**The Dilemma:**

- Financially successful (8.2% revenue increase)
- But discriminates based on communication style
- Correlates with education, income, cultural background

**Your Task:**  
Decide what to do and defend your decision

**Options:** Do nothing, Fix training data ($30K, 6 weeks), Human escalation, Customer education

::: {.notes}
**FACILITATOR ACTIONS:**
- "This is the hardest crisis - no perfect answer"
- "But there IS a leadership responsibility"
- "Read Crisis 4 materials and work through the decision framework"
- Set 20-minute timer
- Let groups wrestle with this
- Don't give answers - this is about their values and reasoning
- After 15 minutes: "5 minutes to finalize your decision"
- After 20 minutes: Quick poll
  - "Who chose Option A (do nothing)? B (fix it)? C (escalation)? D (transparency)?"
  - Ask 2-3 groups to defend their choice (2 min each)
- Key learning: "Ethics aren't optional. Sometimes the right answer costs money and time."
- "AI project leaders must be comfortable wrestling with these questions"
:::

---

## What You Just Practiced

**Crisis 1-4 demonstrated all three levels:**

- **Human-in-the-Loop:** You diagnosed problems, made decisions
- **Human-on-the-Loop:** You monitored AI outputs, validated alerts  
- **Human-in-Command:** You set policies, owned accountability

**This is intentional AI leadership**

---

## Crisis Simulation Debrief

**You just lived through 4 major AI project crises**

**Reflections:**

- Which crisis was hardest? Why?
- What surprised you about your own decisions?
- What would you do differently in your real projects?
- Which frameworks from this morning helped?

**Key Takeaway:**  
AI project leadership is about rapid decision-making under uncertainty, with incomplete information and competing stakeholder demands.

::: {.notes}
- Take 5-10 minutes for this debrief
- "That was intense. You did great work."
- Ask the reflection questions, get 3-4 responses
- Acknowledge the difficulty: "These scenarios are based on real projects I've seen"
- "No perfect answers exist - just thoughtful trade-offs"
- Connect back to morning: "You used stakeholder orchestration, change navigation, ethical leadership"
- Check time - should be close to 2:30pm
- "Let's take our afternoon tea break. You've earned it."
- "When we return, you'll shift from tactical to strategic thinking"
:::

# Exercise 4 {background-color="#003087"}

**Scale or Kill Decisions**

3:00pm - 4:00pm

---

## Scale or Kill Exercise

**Objective:** Make strategic recommendations on AI projects

**You have 3 case studies:**

- **Case A:** Clear Success (inventory AI with 733% ROI)
- **Case B:** Clear Failure (scheduling AI that destroyed morale)
- **Case C:** Ambiguous One (pricing AI - good revenue, bad customer satisfaction)

**Your Task:**

For each case, recommend: **SCALE**, **PIVOT**, or **KILL**  
Defend your decision with evidence and reasoning

::: {.notes}
**FACILITATOR ACTIONS:**
- "Now you shift from tactical to strategic thinking"
- "You'll analyze three AI projects and make recommendations"
- "Case A is straightforward - or is it?"
- "Case B seems obvious - but learn from it"
- "Case C is hard - no perfect answer"
- "You have the Decision Framework reference sheet - use it"
- "60 minutes total:"
  - "15 min: Review all three cases"
  - "30 min: Deep dive on Case C (the hard one)"
  - "15 min: Present your decisions"
- Set timer for 15 minutes for initial review
:::

---

## Case Analysis Time

**15 minutes:** Read all three cases quickly

**30 minutes:** Deep analysis of Case C (Dynamic Pricing)

- 8.2% revenue increase (good!)
- 12-point customer satisfaction drop (bad!)
- Is this a win or a loss?
- Scale it, pivot it, or kill it?
- What's your reasoning?

**Use your Decision Framework reference sheet**

::: {.notes}
- After 15 min: "Okay, you've seen all three cases"
- "Most groups quickly agree on A (scale) and B (kill)"
- "Case C is the interesting one"
- "Spend the next 30 minutes really wrestling with it"
- "What do you optimize for? Short-term revenue or long-term trust?"
- "There's no right answer, but there IS good reasoning vs. poor reasoning"
- Walk around, listen to debates
- After 25 minutes: "5 minutes to finalize your recommendation"
:::

---

## Group Presentations

**Each group: 2-3 minutes**

Present your decision on **Case C** (Dynamic Pricing AI):

- Scale, Pivot, or Kill?
- Your key reasoning
- What metrics drove your decision?
- What trade-offs did you accept?

**Let's hear from each group**

::: {.notes}
**FACILITATOR ACTIONS:**
- Go around the room, each group presents briefly
- Don't let it go long - 2-3 min max per group
- After all present, highlight the diversity:
  - "Fascinating - Group 1 chose Kill, Group 3 chose Scale"
  - "Notice how different values led to different decisions"
  - "Finance lens says scale. Customer experience lens says kill."
- Key learning: "Leadership is about making defensible decisions with imperfect information"
- "Not everyone will agree with you. That's okay."
- "What matters: Clear reasoning, consideration of stakeholders, owning the consequences"
- Check time - should be close to 4:00pm
- "Excellent strategic thinking. One more thing before we close..."
