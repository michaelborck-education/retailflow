**CONSTRAINT CARD A: Budget Cut**

**SURPRISE! Your budget just got cut.**

The CFO just informed you that due to Q3 underperformance, your pilot budget is now **$75K** (down from $150K).

**Adjust your pilot scope:**
- What stays?
- What goes?
- What creative solutions can you find?

**CONSTRAINT CARD B: Timeline Acceleration**

**SURPRISE! Timeline compressed.**

Your Executive Sponsor needs results faster. The board wants to see pilot results in **3 months**, not 6.

**Adjust your pilot plan:**
- What can you deliver in 3 months?
- What risks does this create?
- How do you push back if needed?

**CONSTRAINT CARD C: Team Resistance**

**SURPRISE! Your customer service team is hostile.**

Word leaked about the AI project. The team believes their jobs are at risk. Morale is low and cooperation is minimal.

**Adjust your approach:**
- How do you rebuild trust?
- What changes to pilot design?
- What's your communication strategy?

**CONSTRAINT CARD D: Data Quality Issues**

**SURPRISE! Your data is a mess.**

IT just informed you that customer service tickets are inconsistently categorized, 30% have no resolution notes, and there's no clean historical data for AI training.

**Adjust your approach:**
- How does this change your pilot?
- What data work is needed first?
- Does this change your timeline?

---

**CONSTRAINT CARD E: Vendor Lock-in Warning**

**SURPRISE! IT Security raises red flags.**

The security team reviewed your preferred AI vendor and identified major concerns: proprietary data format, expensive exit costs, and unclear data ownership.

**Adjust your approach:**
- Do you change vendors?
- What requirements do you add?
- How does this affect your timeline/budget?

**CONSTRAINT CARD F: Executive Scope Creep**

**SURPRISE! Your sponsor wants more.**

Your executive sponsor just asked: *"While we're building AI for customer service, can we also do product recommendations and personalized marketing? It's all the same technology, right?"*

**Adjust your approach:**
- How do you respond?
- Does scope expand or stay focused?
- What's your negotiation strategy?
