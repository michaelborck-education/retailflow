#### **ROLE CARD 1: Data Scientist / AI Engineer**

**Your Background:**
You have a PhD in Machine Learning and 5 years experience. You're excited about this AI project but frustrated by unrealistic expectations.

**Your Hidden Concerns:**
- Management wants results in 3 months; you know it needs 6-9 months to do it right
- The data quality is poor - "garbage in, garbage out"
- You're worried about technical debt if we rush
- You want to use state-of-the-art models, but IT wants "proven technology"

**Your Secret Motivation:**
This project could be a career-maker - you want it to succeed, but only if it's done properly. You'd rather kill a project than launch something that fails publicly.

**Your Language:**
Use terms like: "model accuracy," "training data," "edge cases," "false positives"

**In Conversations, You:**
- Ask about data quality and availability
- Push back on unrealistic timelines
- Want clear success metrics defined upfront
- Get frustrated when people expect "magic"

#### **ROLE CARD 2: Operations Manager**

**Your Background:**
You've been with the company 15 years. You've seen 3 "revolutionary" tech projects fail. You run a tight operation and don't want disruption.

**Your Hidden Concerns:**
- "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" - current system works fine
- Your team is already stretched thin
- You don't understand AI and that makes you uncomfortable
- Last time IT implemented something, it crashed for 2 weeks

**Your Secret Motivation:**
You're 5 years from retirement. You want stability, not chaos. But you also don't want to be seen as "the person who blocked innovation."

**Your Language:**
Practical, skeptical: "How does this actually work?" "What if it breaks?" "Who's responsible?"

**In Conversations, You:**
- Ask "what could go wrong?"
- Want proof it works elsewhere first
- Need guarantees about backup plans
- Worried about your team's workload during implementation

#### **ROLE CARD 3: End User (Store Manager / Frontline Staff)**

**Your Background:**
You manage a busy retail store with 20 staff. You're already juggling inventory, customers, staffing, and corporate demands.

**Your Hidden Concerns:**
- "Will this AI replace my job or my team's jobs?"
- You barely have time to learn the current systems
- You don't trust technology that you don't understand
- Corporate always rolls out systems without asking what you actually need

**Your Secret Motivation:**
You want tools that make your job easier, not harder. You're tired of being a guinea pig for IT projects. If this AI actually helps, you'll champion it. If it creates more work, you'll quietly sabotage it.

**Your Language:**
Practical, people-focused: "How does this help my team?" "Is this complicated to use?"

**In Conversations, You:**
- Ask how this affects daily work
- Want to know about training and support
- Worried about job security (yours and your team's)
- Need it to be simple and reliable

#### **ROLE CARD 4: IT Security Manager**

**Your Background:**
You're responsible for protecting company data and systems. You've dealt with 2 data breaches in your career - never again on your watch.

**Your Hidden Concerns:**
- AI systems are black boxes - security nightmare
- Where is the data stored? Who has access?
- What about customer privacy and GDPR compliance?
- AI can be hacked or manipulated
- This project is moving fast - corners will be cut

**Your Secret Motivation:**
Your job is to say "no" until risks are managed. You're not anti-innovation, but security cannot be an afterthought. One breach could end your career.

**Your Language:**
Risk-focused: "attack vectors," "data governance," "compliance," "audit trail"

**In Conversations, You:**
- Ask about security architecture
- Want to know who's reviewed the vendor
- Insist on security requirements upfront
- Flag regulatory compliance issues
- Seem like "Dr. No" but you're just doing your job

#### **ROLE CARD 5: Finance / CFO**

**Your Background:**
You control the budget. You approved this AI pilot with skepticism - you've seen too many tech projects go over budget with unclear ROI.

**Your Hidden Concerns:**
- What's the real cost? (Hint: always more than initial estimate)
- When do we see ROI? Can we measure it?
- What's the opportunity cost - what else could we fund?
- If this fails, it comes out of next year's innovation budget

**Your Secret Motivation:**
You need wins to show the board. Quick, measurable wins. You'll fund long-term bets if the business case is solid, but you're tired of "strategic investments" that go nowhere.

**Your Language:**
Numbers-focused: "ROI," "payback period," "cost-benefit," "burn rate"

**In Conversations, You:**
- Ask for specific cost estimates
- Want ROI projections with assumptions
- Need clear success metrics
- Push for phased investment ("prove it in pilot first")
- Ask "what if we do nothing?"

---

#### **ROLE CARD 6: Executive Sponsor**

**Your Background:**
You're a VP who championed this AI initiative to the CEO. Your reputation is on the line. You need this to succeed - publicly.

**Your Hidden Concerns:**
- The board expects results by Q4
- Competitors are moving faster than us
- You don't fully understand the technology
- If this fails, you look bad; if it succeeds, you look like a visionary
- You need good news to report at the next board meeting

**Your Secret Motivation:**
You want glory and career advancement. You're pushing this project hard because you need a win. You'll pressure the team for faster results, even if that's not realistic.

**Your Language:**
Big-picture: "strategic advantage," "transformation," "innovation," "market leadership"

**In Conversations, You:**
- Focus on timeline and visibility
- Want impressive demos for executives
- Less interested in technical details
- Push to expand scope ("while we're at it...")
- Ask "can we accelerate this?"
