**CASE STUDY: RetailFlow Customer Service Challenge**

**Background:**

RetailFlow is a regional retail chain with 50 stores and growing e-commerce. Customer satisfaction scores have dropped from 78% to 68% over the past year. The main complaint? Slow customer service response times.

**Current State:**

**Customer Service Metrics:**
- Average email response time: 26 hours
- Average phone wait time: 12 minutes
- Customer satisfaction: 68% (down from 78%)
- Service team: 25 people across 3 shifts
- Ticket volume: 2,500 per week
- Cost per ticket resolved: $18

**Common Query Types:**
- Order status/tracking: 35%
- Returns/refunds: 25%
- Product questions: 20%
- Technical issues: 15%
- Complaints: 5%

**Current Process:**
- All queries go into shared inbox
- Team members manually triage and respond
- No automated responses
- Knowledge base exists but is outdated
- Escalation process is unclear

**The Challenge:**

Your Executive Sponsor (CEO) has approved an AI pilot project to improve customer service. She said: *"I want AI to fix this problem. Get it done by Q4."*

**Your Resources:**
- Budget: $150K for pilot (software, consulting, training)
- Timeline: 6 months to pilot, then decide to scale or kill
- Team: You, 1 data analyst, access to IT support, customer service manager

**The Problem:**

You need to scope this pilot. Too ambitious = failure. Too timid = no learnings.

**Your Task:**

Design a pilot that's "just right" - ambitious enough to prove value, constrained enough to succeed.
