# CRISIS MANAGEMENT SIMULATION
## AI Customer Service Chatbot Implementation

---

## SCENARIO SETUP

**You are 2 months into deploying** an AI-powered customer service chatbot for RetailFlow. 

After 6 weeks of development and testing, the pilot launched **one week ago** to handle approximately 30% of customer queries, specifically:
- Order tracking and status
- Return policy questions  
- Basic product information

Initial results in controlled testing were promising:
- 85% accuracy rate
- Average response time: 2 minutes (vs. 26 hours for human agents)
- Positive feedback from test users

**Now you're dealing with real customers, real volume, and real problems.**

---

## YOUR ROLE TODAY

**You are the Project Manager** leading this AI implementation.

**Your team includes:**
- Data Scientist (built the AI model)
- Customer Service Manager (represents frontline staff)
- IT Support (maintains systems)
- Executive Sponsor (your VP, who's watching closely)

---

## WHAT'S COMING

You will face **FOUR crisis scenarios** that unfold in real-time:

1. **Data Quality Crisis** (20 minutes) - Technical failure
2. **Staff Resistance** (25 minutes) - People problem
3. **Executive Pressure** (25 minutes) - Leadership challenge
4. **Ethical Dilemma** (20 minutes) - Values decision

---

## YOUR OBJECTIVES

For each crisis, you must:
- ✅ **Diagnose** the problem quickly with limited information
- ✅ **Decide** on immediate action (sometimes with no perfect option)
- ✅ **Communicate** with stakeholders effectively
- ✅ **Document** your reasoning and decisions

---

## GROUND RULES

**Work as a group:**
- Discuss options openly
- Debate trade-offs
- Reach consensus on decisions
- Document your rationale

**Time pressure is real:**
- You have limited time per crisis (just like real emergencies)
- Some decisions must be made with incomplete information
- You can't pause to "gather more data" indefinitely

**No perfect answers:**
- Some crises have only "less bad" options
- Trade-offs are inevitable
- Your reasoning matters as much as your decision

**Document everything:**
- Write down your decisions
- Capture your rationale
- You'll present these to the room

## TIPS FOR SUCCESS

**Don't panic:** Take 2 minutes to understand the situation before jumping to solutions

**Listen to all perspectives:** Your group has diverse experience - use it

**Consider second-order effects:** What happens AFTER your immediate action?

**Communicate clearly:** Stakeholders need different messages (CEO vs. technical team vs. customers)

**Learn from each crisis:** Insights from Crisis 1 will help with Crisis 4

## FACILITATOR WILL PROVIDE:

- Crisis scenario documents (handed out in sequence)
- Role-play interactions (facilitator plays resistant employee, demanding CEO)
- Data/logs to analyze
- Templates for responses

## LET'S BEGIN...

**Get ready for Crisis #1**

Your facilitator will distribute the first scenario when everyone is ready.

Remember: Stay calm, think clearly, decide confidently.
