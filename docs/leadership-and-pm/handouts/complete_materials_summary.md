- All scenarios based on real AI project challenges
- No "right" answers in complex cases

### ü§ù Interactive & Collaborative
- Role-play conversations
- Group problem-solving
- Peer learning
- Competitive but collaborative

### üìä Evidence-Based
- All exercises produce artifacts
- Group work captured
- Personal reflections collected
- Satisfies CRL requirements

### üîÑ Progressive Complexity
- Morning: Learn frameworks
- Early afternoon: Apply to crises
- Late afternoon: Make strategic decisions
- End: Personal application

## WHAT MAKES THIS WORK

### Differentiation from Business Innovation Course:
- **Tactical vs Strategic:** This is hands-on implementation, not portfolio strategy
- **Execution focus:** Managing specific projects, not choosing which projects
- **People-heavy:** Change management, stakeholder relations, team dynamics
- **Timeline:** 6-18 months (project lifecycle) not 3-5 years (strategy)

### Learning Outcomes Alignment:
‚úÖ **Master AI Project Design** - Pilot Scoping Exercise  
‚úÖ **Lead Effective AI Teams** - Stakeholder Speed Dating + Crisis 2  
‚úÖ **Navigate Ethical Challenges** - Crisis 4  
‚úÖ **Plan for AI Scalability** - Scale or Kill Cases  
‚úÖ **Apply AI Best Practices** - Decision Framework + all exercises

### Engagement Mechanisms:
- **Role-play:** Forces perspective-taking
- **Time pressure:** Mimics real urgency
- **Group dynamics:** Debate and consensus-building
- **Real stakes:** Decisions have consequences in scenarios
- **Surprise twists:** Constraint cards, crisis escalations

## MATERIALS NOT YET CREATED

### You Still Need To Develop:

**1. Opening Presentation (9:00-10:30am)**
- AI Project Management Frameworks
- Case studies of successful implementations
- Key concepts introduction
- Could use slides or interactive discussion

**Suggestion:** Keep it short (~30 min presentation, 60 min for first group exercise)

- Need actual article URLs
- Send via organizers 48 hours before

**3. Slides (Optional)**
- Exercise instructions (can project instead of just verbal)
- Timing reminders
- Debrief frameworks
- Closing slide with feedback QR code (organizers provided)

**Note:** All exercises work fine without slides - materials are self-contained

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### If materials seem too long:
- Participants won't read every word during exercises
- They skim for relevant info (realistic for time pressure)
- Extra detail helps different learning styles
- Can always say "Focus on pages 1-2 for this exercise"

### If you want to simplify:
- Remove Crisis 3 (Executive Pressure) - combine with Crisis 2
- Shorten Scale or Kill to just Case C (the ambiguous one)
- Make Personal Reflection shorter (but keep for CRL)

### If you want to add:
- Opening icebreaker (Superhero game you mentioned)
- Mid-afternoon energizer
- More debrief/discussion time
- Guest speaker (someone who led AI project)

---

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

### During the Day:
- Animated group discussions
- Healthy debate
- People staying in role during role-plays
- "Aha!" moments during debriefs
- Time flying by
- Participants taking notes
- Engagement in reflection exercise

### After the Day:
- Participants have concrete action plans
- They understand AI project challenges viscerally
- They've practiced difficult conversations
- They have frameworks to apply Monday
- Positive feedback scores
- CRL evidence collected

### Long-Term:
- Participants implement learnings
- They share insights with colleagues
- Word-of-mouth promotes future sessions
- You get invited back
- RetailFlow becomes a useful case they remember

## YOUR ASSETS vs NEEDED MATERIALS

### ‚úÖ Assets You Have That We Used:
- **RetailFlow concept** (created as replacement for CloudCore)
- **Interactive exercise philosophy** (discovery-based learning)
- **CRL requirements** (built into reflection)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Assets Not Used (Save for Business Innovation):
- **CloudCore chatbots** - Better for strategic course
- **Superhero privacy game** - Could add as icebreaker
- **Your programming skills** - Could build tools for future iterations

---

## FEEDBACK MECHANISM

### After Running This:
Track what worked:
- Which exercises got best engagement?
- Where did timing work/not work?
- Which case studies resonated most?
- What questions came up repeatedly?
- What would you change?

### Iterate For Next Time:
- Refine based on feedback
- Add/remove/adjust exercises
- Update scenarios to be more current
- Build digital tools if helpful
