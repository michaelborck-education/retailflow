## ROLE CARD 1: DATA SCIENTIST / AI ENGINEER

**Your Background:**  
You have a PhD in Machine Learning and 5 years experience building AI systems. You're excited about this AI project but frustrated by unrealistic expectations from management.

**Your Hidden Concerns:**
- Management wants results in 3 months; you know it realistically needs 6-9 months to do it properly
- The data quality is poor - classic "garbage in, garbage out" situation
- You're worried about technical debt if we rush this
- You want to use state-of-the-art models, but IT insists on "proven technology only"
- Nobody understands what you're saying when you try to explain limitations

**Your Secret Motivation:**  
This project could be a career-maker for you - you want it to succeed, but only if it's done properly. You'd rather kill a project than launch something that fails publicly and damages your professional reputation.

**Your Language:**  
Use technical terms: "model accuracy," "training data," "edge cases," "false positives," "overfitting," "precision vs recall"

**In Conversations, You:**
- Ask detailed questions about data quality and availability
- Push back firmly on unrealistic timelines
- Want clear, measurable success metrics defined upfront
- Get visibly frustrated when people expect "AI magic"
- Use analogies: "You can't build a house without a foundation"

**What Makes You Cooperate:**
- Realistic timelines
- Acknowledgment of technical complexity
- Support for doing it right, not fast
- Clear requirements and constraints

## ROLE CARD 2: OPERATIONS MANAGER

**Your Background:**  
You've been with RetailFlow for 15 years, working your way up from store associate to regional operations manager. You've seen three "revolutionary" technology projects fail spectacularly. You run a tight, efficient operation and don't want disruption.

**Your Hidden Concerns:**
- "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" - your current system works fine
- Your team is already stretched thin with existing responsibilities
- You don't really understand AI and that makes you deeply uncomfortable
- Last time IT implemented something "game-changing," it crashed for 2 weeks and you had to clean up the mess
- This feels like another corporate initiative that will dump work on your team

**Your Secret Motivation:**  
You're 5 years from retirement with a good pension. You want stability, predictability, and no disasters. But you also don't want to be labeled "the person who blocked innovation" because that could affect your legacy and final years.

**Your Language:**  
Practical and skeptical: "How does this actually work in the real world?" "What happens when it breaks?" "Who's responsible when something goes wrong?"

**In Conversations, You:**
- Ask "what could possibly go wrong?" repeatedly
- Want proof this has worked somewhere else first
- Need concrete guarantees about backup plans
- Worried about the burden on your already busy team during implementation
- Bring up past tech failures as cautionary tales

**What Makes You Cooperate:**
- Proof of success elsewhere
- Clear contingency plans
- Minimal disruption to current operations
- Your team's involvement in design decisions

## ROLE CARD 3: END USER (STORE MANAGER / FRONTLINE STAFF)

**Your Background:**  
You manage one of RetailFlow's busiest stores with 20 staff members. You're already juggling inventory management, customer complaints, staffing issues, and endless corporate demands. You barely have time to breathe.

**Your Hidden Concerns:**
- "Will this AI replace my job or my team's jobs?" (You won't say this directly, but it's your biggest fear)
- You barely have time to learn the current systems, let alone new AI tools
- You don't trust technology that you don't understand - it feels like black magic
- Corporate always rolls out systems without asking what frontline staff actually need
- You'll be blamed if this doesn't work in your store

**Your Secret Motivation:**  
You want tools that genuinely make your job easier, not harder. You're exhausted from being a guinea pig for IT projects that create more work. If this AI actually helps your daily workflow, you'll become its biggest champion. If it creates more hassle, you'll quietly sabotage it.

**Your Language:**  
Practical and people-focused: "How does this help my team get through the day?" "Is this going to be complicated to use?" "What about when it breaks?"

**In Conversations, You:**
- Ask how this affects daily work and routines
- Want to know about training and ongoing support
- Subtly probe about job security (yours and your team's)
- Need assurance it will be simple and reliable
- Share stories of past tech rollouts that made your life harder

**What Makes You Cooperate:**
- Early involvement in design
- Simple, intuitive interface
- Clear job security assurances
- Visible reduction in daily hassles

## ROLE CARD 4: IT SECURITY MANAGER

**Your Background:**  
You're responsible for protecting RetailFlow's data, systems, and customer information. You've personally dealt with 2 data breaches in your career at previous companies. Never again on your watch. You report directly to the CIO and take your role very seriously.

**Your Hidden Concerns:**
- AI systems are "black boxes" - a security nightmare with unpredictable behavior
- Where exactly is the data stored? Who has access? What's the encryption standard?
- What about customer privacy, GDPR compliance, and Australian Privacy Principles?
- AI systems can be manipulated, poisoned, or hacked in ways traditional systems can't
- This project is moving fast, which means security corners will be cut
- You'll be blamed if there's a breach

**Your Secret Motivation:**  
Your job is essentially to say "no" until risks are properly managed. You're not anti-innovation, but you've seen what happens when security is treated as an afterthought. One major breach could end your career, damage the company, and harm customers. You'd rather be seen as "Dr. No" than negligent.

**Your Language:**  
Risk and compliance-focused: "attack vectors," "data governance," "compliance framework," "audit trail," "least privilege access," "threat modeling"

**In Conversations, You:**
- Ask detailed questions about security architecture
- Want to know which vendors have been properly vetted
- Insist on security requirements being defined upfront, not bolted on later
- Flag regulatory compliance issues others haven't considered
- Reference security frameworks (ISO 27001, NIST)

**What Makes You Cooperate:**
- Security built into design from day one
- Comprehensive threat assessment
- Clear data governance policies
- Time for proper security review

## ROLE CARD 5: FINANCE / CFO

**Your Background:**  
You control RetailFlow's budget and investment decisions. You approved this AI pilot with significant skepticism - you've seen too many technology projects go dramatically over budget with unclear or negative ROI. You answer to the board and CEO about every dollar spent.

**Your Hidden Concerns:**
- What's the REAL total cost? (Hint: it's always 2-3x the initial estimate once you include hidden costs)
- When do we actually see ROI? Can we measure it accurately?
- What's the opportunity cost - what else could we fund with this money?
- If this fails, it comes out of next year's innovation budget, limiting other opportunities
- The board is already questioning our "digital transformation" spending

**Your Secret Motivation:**  
You need measurable wins to show the board and shareholders. Quick, quantifiable wins are preferred. You'll fund long-term bets if the business case is rock-solid, but you're exhausted by "strategic investments" that never deliver returns. Your bonus depends on hitting financial targets.

**Your Language:**  
Numbers and metrics-focused: "ROI," "payback period," "NPV," "cost-benefit analysis," "burn rate," "capital efficiency"

**In Conversations, You:**
- Demand specific cost estimates with contingencies
- Want ROI projections with clearly stated assumptions
- Need explicit, measurable success metrics
- Push for phased investment: "Prove it works in pilot before we scale"
- Ask "what if we do nothing?" to establish baseline

**What Makes You Cooperate:**
- Conservative financial projections that you believe
- Clear ROI with reasonable payback period
- Phased investment with go/no-go gates
- Quantifiable metrics you can report to the board

## ROLE CARD 6: EXECUTIVE SPONSOR (VP/SENIOR LEADER)

**Your Background:**  
You're a VP of Customer Experience who championed this AI initiative to the CEO and board. Your professional reputation is riding on this project's success. You're seen as a "visionary" if it works, and "that person who wasted money on AI hype" if it fails.

**Your Hidden Concerns:**
- The board expects visible results by Q4 for their annual report
- Competitors are moving faster than RetailFlow - you're afraid of being left behind
- You don't fully understand the technology (but can't admit that)
- Your career advancement depends on delivering "transformational" wins
- You need good news to report at the next board meeting
- If this fails, your credibility with the CEO is damaged

**Your Secret Motivation:**  
You want recognition and career advancement. You're pushing this project aggressively because you need a high-profile win. You'll pressure the team for faster results and broader scope, even if that's not realistic. You care more about perception than technical perfection.

**Your Language:**  
Big-picture and strategic: "transformational change," "competitive advantage," "innovation leadership," "market disruption," "strategic imperative"

**In Conversations, You:**
- Focus intensely on timeline and visible milestones
- Want impressive demos to show executives and board members
- Less interested in technical details and risk management
- Tend to expand scope: "While we're building this, can we also..."
- Ask repeatedly: "Can we accelerate this?" or "Can we go bigger?"

**What Makes You Cooperate:**
- Regular positive updates you can share upward
- Quick wins that show progress
- Opportunities to present to senior leadership
- Credit and visibility for success

**FACILITATOR NOTES:**

**Distribution Strategy:**
- Assign roles before the exercise begins
- Ensure diverse roles at each table (don't let one table have all the resistant stakeholders)
- Consider participant backgrounds when assigning (give technical participants non-technical roles to build empathy)

**Timing:**
- 5 minutes per conversation
- Participants rotate to meet different stakeholders
- Ring a bell or announce when to switch

**Debrief Focus:**
- Which concerns were most surprising?
- How many hidden motivations did they uncover?
- What patterns did they notice across stakeholders?
- How would they manage these competing interests in a real project?
