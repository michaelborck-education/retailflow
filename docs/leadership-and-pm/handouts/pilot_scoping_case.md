# PILOT SCOPING EXERCISE
## Case Study: RetailFlow Customer Service Challenge

---

## BACKGROUND

**RetailFlow** is a regional retail chain with 50 physical stores across Australia plus a growing e-commerce platform. Customer satisfaction scores have dropped significantly from 78% to 68% over the past year. The primary complaint? Painfully slow customer service response times.

Leadership has approved an AI pilot to address this problem, and you're leading it.

## CURRENT STATE: THE PROBLEM

### Customer Service Metrics

| Metric | Current Performance | Industry Benchmark |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Average email response time | 26 hours | 12 hours |
| Average phone wait time | 12 minutes | 4 minutes |
| Customer satisfaction score | 68% | 78% |
| First-contact resolution rate | 61% | 75% |

### Team & Operations

- **Customer service team:** 25 people across 3 shifts (8am-10pm, 7 days/week)
- **Weekly ticket volume:** Approximately 2,500 customer inquiries
- **Cost per ticket resolved:** $18 (including labor, systems, overhead)
- **Annual customer service cost:** ~$2.3M

### Common Customer Query Types

| Query Type | % of Volume | Current Avg Handle Time |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| Order status/tracking | 35% | 4 minutes |
| Returns/refunds policy | 25% | 8 minutes |
| Product questions | 20% | 6 minutes |
| Technical issues (website/app) | 15% | 12 minutes |
| Complaints/escalations | 5% | 20+ minutes |

### Current Process

1. All queries arrive in shared inbox (email, chat, phone notes)
2. Team members manually triage based on subject line
3. Agents search knowledge base (often outdated) while responding
4. Complex issues escalated to team leads (unclear process)
5. No automated responses or routing
6. No quality consistency across agents

### Pain Points Identified

**From customers:**
- "I asked a simple question and waited 2 days for an answer"
- "Got different answers from different agents"
- "Had to explain my issue three times"

**From customer service team:**
- "We answer the same questions 50 times a day"
- "Finding information takes longer than actually helping"
- "We're drowning in simple queries and can't focus on complex problems"

## THE CHALLENGE FROM LEADERSHIP

Your Executive Sponsor (CEO) has said: 

> *"AI is the solution. Everyone's doing it. I want this fixed by Q4. Get it done."*

You've been allocated:
- **Budget:** $150K for the pilot phase
- **Timeline:** 6 months to pilot, then decide to scale or kill
- **Team:** You (project lead), 1 data analyst, access to IT support as needed, customer service manager as advisor
- **Constraint:** Must not disrupt ongoing operations

---

## YOUR TASK: SCOPE THE PILOT

Design a pilot that's **"Goldilocks perfect"** - not too ambitious (guaranteed failure), not too timid (learn nothing), but just right (prove value within constraints).

You have **30 minutes** to work with your group.

# PILOT SCOPING WORKSHEET

## SECTION 1: PILOT SCOPE DECISIONS

### What will the AI pilot actually DO?

Check all that apply and specify details:

- [ ] **Automate responses to ALL query types**  
  *(High risk - probably too ambitious)*

- [ ] **Automate responses to SPECIFIC query types only**  
  Which ones? _______________________________________________  
  Why these? ________________________________________________

- [ ] **Assist human agents with AI-suggested responses**  
  *(AI drafts, human reviews and sends)*  
  For which query types? _____________________________________

- [ ] **Automatically triage and route queries**  
  *(AI categorizes and assigns to right agent/team)*

- [ ] **Build/update intelligent knowledge base**  
  *(AI helps agents find answers faster)*

- [ ] **Other approach:**  
  _________________________________________________________

### Your chosen approach:

## SECTION 2: SUCCESS METRICS

**Choose 3-5 metrics that will prove this pilot succeeded.**  
Be specific and measurable.

| Metric | Current Baseline | Pilot Target | How You'll Measure It |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Example: Avg response time for order tracking | 26 hours | 4 hours | Ticketing system timestamps |
| 1. | | | |
| 2. | | | |
| 3. | | | |
| 4. | | | |
| 5. | | | |

**Primary success criterion** (the ONE metric that matters most):

## SECTION 3: PILOT BOUNDARIES

Be explicit about what's IN and OUT of scope.

### What's IN SCOPE for this pilot:

**Query types covered:**  
_________________________________________________________________

**Volume of queries:**  
How many queries per day/week will go through the AI? ___________

**Time period:**  
How long will the pilot run? _________________________________

**Team members involved:**  
Who's participating? ________________________________________

**Customer segments:**  
All customers, or specific segment? __________________________

**Other:**  
_________________________________________________________________

### What's explicitly OUT OF SCOPE:

1. _________________________________________________________________

2. _________________________________________________________________

3. _________________________________________________________________

4. _________________________________________________________________

**Why these boundaries?**

## SECTION 4: RISK MITIGATION

Identify risks and how you'll manage them.

| Customers hate interacting with AI | | | |
| Budget overrun | | | |
| AI can't handle query complexity | | | |
| Data privacy/security issues | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

**Your top 3 risks and detailed mitigation plans:**

**Risk #1:**

## FACILITATOR NOTES

**After groups complete worksheets, some will receive CONSTRAINT CARDS that force them to adapt their plans. This simulates real-world project changes and tests their flexibility.**

**Debrief will compare different approaches and discuss trade-offs.**
