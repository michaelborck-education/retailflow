## CONSTRAINT CARD A: BUDGET CUT üí∞

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SURPRISE! Your budget just got slashed.

**THE NEWS:**  
The CFO just informed you that due to Q3 underperformance across the business, ALL innovation projects are facing budget cuts. 

**Your pilot budget is now $75,000** (down from $150,000).

The CFO says: *"Make it work with half. Or we cancel the whole thing."*

---

**YOUR TASK:**

**1. What gets cut from your plan?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**2. What absolutely must stay?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**3. What creative alternatives can you find?**  
(Open-source tools? Internal resources? Phased approach?)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**4. Does your scope change? How?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**5. What's your pitch to keep this project alive?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## CONSTRAINT CARD B: TIMELINE ACCELERATION ‚è±Ô∏è

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SURPRISE! Your timeline just got compressed.

**THE NEWS:**  
Your Executive Sponsor just returned from a board meeting. The board wants to see results from this AI initiative **by Q4** (3 months from now, not 6).

The CEO said: *"Competitors are moving faster. We need to show AI progress this quarter. Can you deliver in 3 months?"*

---

**YOUR TASK:**

**1. What can you realistically deliver in 3 months?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**2. What gets pushed to a "Phase 2" later?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**3. What new risks does this acceleration create?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**4. Should you push back? If yes, what's your argument?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**5. What's your counteroffer/compromise?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## CONSTRAINT CARD C: TEAM RESISTANCE üò†

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SURPRISE! Your customer service team is hostile to this project.

**THE NEWS:**  
Word leaked about the AI customer service pilot before official communication. The team believes their jobs are at risk. Morale is low, cooperation is minimal, and the union has gotten involved.

The team lead said: *"You're building our replacement. Why would we help?"*

---

**YOUR TASK:**

**1. How do you rebuild trust immediately?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**2. What changes to your pilot design address their concerns?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**3. What's your communication strategy now?**  
(What do you say? To whom? When?)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**4. How do you get them involved as partners, not victims?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**5. What promises can you make (and keep)?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## CONSTRAINT CARD D: DATA QUALITY DISASTER üìä

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SURPRISE! Your data is a complete mess.

**THE NEWS:**  
IT just completed a data audit and found serious problems:
- Customer service tickets are inconsistently categorized (30+ different category names for the same issues)
- 30% of tickets have no resolution notes
- Historical data before 2023 is in a deprecated system and would cost $40K to extract
- Customer information has duplicates and errors
- No clean training data exists for the AI

IT Manager says: *"You can't train an AI on garbage data. This needs 2-3 months of cleanup first."*

---

**YOUR TASK:**

**1. How does this change your pilot approach?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**2. What data work must happen before AI work?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**3. Can you start the pilot with limited data? How?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**4. Does this change your timeline and budget?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**5. What's your revised plan?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## CONSTRAINT CARD E: VENDOR LOCK-IN WARNING üîí

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SURPRISE! IT Security raises red flags about your chosen vendor.

**THE NEWS:**  
The IT Security team reviewed your preferred AI vendor's contract and architecture. Major concerns identified:

- Proprietary data format makes switching vendors nearly impossible
- Expensive exit fees if you cancel ($50K termination penalty)
- Unclear data ownership (vendor claims rights to your customer data for "model improvement")
- Cloud-only solution with no on-premise option (security risk)
- 5-year minimum contract commitment

Security Manager says: *"This vendor will hold us hostage. I can't recommend approval."*

---

**YOUR TASK:**

**1. Do you change vendors? (This might delay project 6-8 weeks)**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**2. What new requirements do you add to vendor selection?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**3. How do you balance security concerns vs. timeline pressure?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**4. Can you negotiate better terms? What's negotiable?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**5. What's your recommendation to leadership?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## CONSTRAINT CARD F: EXECUTIVE SCOPE CREEP üìà

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SURPRISE! Your sponsor wants to expand the project dramatically.

**THE NEWS:**  
Your executive sponsor just returned from a conference where they saw impressive AI demos. They're now super excited and want more.

The VP said: *"While we're building AI for customer service, let's also add:*
- *Personalized product recommendations*
- *Automated marketing email campaigns*
- *Chatbot for sales support*
- *It's all the same AI technology, right? Shouldn't take much longer."*

They're presenting this "expanded vision" to the CEO tomorrow and expect your support.

---

**YOUR TASK:**

**1. What's your immediate response?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**2. What's realistic vs. what's not?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**3. How do you say "no" without damaging the relationship?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**4. What's your counter-proposal?**  
(Phase approach? Pilot first, expand later?)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**5. What data/evidence do you need to support your position?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## FACILITATOR NOTES

**Distribution:**
- Wait until groups have completed their initial pilot scoping (30 minutes)
- Randomly distribute ONE constraint card per group
- Give groups 10 minutes to adapt their plans
- Have each group briefly present: "Here's what we had to change and why"

**Debrief Focus:**
- Which constraint was hardest to accommodate?
- What trade-offs did groups make?
- How did constraints reveal priorities?
- What does this teach about real-world project management?

**Key Learning:**  
No plan survives first contact with reality. Flexibility and clear priorities are essential.
