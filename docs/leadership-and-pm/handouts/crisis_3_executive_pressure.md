You're feeling cautiously optimistic.

**Then this email arrives...**

## THE EMAIL

**FROM:** Emma Rodriguez, VP Customer Experience (Your Executive Sponsor)  
**TO:** You  
**CC:** CEO  
**SUBJECT:** AI Chatbot - Accelerate Rollout

**SENT:** Friday 1:47 PM

> Hi Team,
>
> Great progress on getting the pilot back on track. I just presented early results to the Board of Directors yesterday, and they're very excited about our AI initiative.
>
> The board sees this as critical to RetailFlow's competitive positioning. Several board members pointed out that our competitors are moving much faster with AI adoption.
>
> Based on the board discussion, **I need us to accelerate our timeline significantly.**
>
> **New Target: Full deployment by end of Q4** (8 weeks from today)
>
> **Expanded Scope:**
> - ALL customer service queries (not just the current 30%)
> - Sales support inquiries
> - Technical troubleshooting (website/app issues)
> - Social media response automation
>
> I know we originally planned:
> - 6 months for pilot phase ✓ (we're in month 3)
> - 3 months for evaluation
> - 6 months for gradual rollout
>
> But the board is watching this very closely as a bellwether for our digital transformation. **We need to show aggressive innovation, not incremental progress.**
>
> **Additional consideration:** The board asked, "Can this AI also handle outbound marketing campaigns and personalized customer communications?" Definitely worth exploring as we scale.
>
> Let's meet Monday morning at 8am to discuss the accelerated plan. Please come prepared with:
> - Updated timeline for full rollout (8 weeks)
> - Resource requirements
> - Budget for expanded scope
> - Quick wins we can announce to market
>
> I'm presenting this "expanded vision" to the CEO on Tuesday and will need your support.
>
> This is a huge opportunity for the team - and for RetailFlow. Let's make it happen.
>
> Emma

## YOUR IMMEDIATE REACTION

**Internal monologue:** *"This is a terrible idea."*

---

## THE REALITY CHECK

You review what you actually know:

### What's Working (Current Pilot):
- ✅ Simple query types (order tracking, basic returns)
- ✅ 30% of total volume
- ✅ Heavily monitored
- ✅ Team cooperation improving

### What's NOT Ready:
- ❌ Technical troubleshooting (requires specialized knowledge)
- ❌ Complex customer scenarios (need human judgment)
- ❌ Sales support (needs persuasion skills, product expertise)
- ❌ Social media (brand voice, crisis management, real-time)
- ❌ Team still rebuilding trust (only 2 weeks since union incident)
- ❌ Only 3 months of data (need more to validate model)

### Timeline Reality:
- **What Emma wants:** Full deployment in 8 weeks
- **What's realistic:** 
  - 3 months to expand bot capabilities
  - 2 months for thorough testing
  - 3 months for gradual rollout
  - **Total: 8 more months minimum**

### The Risks:
- Rushing = higher failure risk
- Expanding too fast = compromising what's working
- Complex queries = more ways to fail publicly
- Team burnout = losing the cooperation you just rebuilt
- Brand damage = one viral "AI fail" could hurt RetailFlow

## BUT ALSO...

You understand Emma's position:

- She championed this project to the CEO and board
- Her credibility is on the line
- Board pressure is real
- Competitors ARE moving faster
- She needs wins for her career
- The company does need to innovate

And you think about YOUR position:
- Your performance review is coming up
- This could be a career-making project if it succeeds
- Or career-damaging if you're seen as "the blocker"
- Emma has significant influence over your future
- Maybe you're being too cautious?
- What if competitors really are gaining an advantage?

---

## THE MEETING

It's Monday morning, 8:00 AM. You're sitting across from Emma in her office.

- Enthusiastic and persuasive

**Do you:**

**What would make you walk away from this project?**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**How do you balance:**
- Professional duty (deliver what's asked)

- Realistic assessment (knowing the technical constraints)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

#### WHAT IF YOU SAID YES?

**If you agreed to the 8-week accelerated timeline, what would your plan be?**

What would you sacrifice/descope to make it possible?

&nbsp;

What additional resources would you need?

&nbsp;

What would your contingency plan be when it starts going wrong?

&nbsp;

### PHASE 4: REFLECTION (Bonus)

**Questions to consider:**

**About Executive Pressure:**
- How do you say "no" to a senior leader without career damage?
- When is pushback appropriate vs. being "not a team player"?
- How do you present bad news or realistic timelines?

**About Risk:**
- When should you accept risk and when should you refuse?
- How much of your concern is legitimate vs. overcautious?
- What's the cost of being wrong in each direction?

**About Career:**
- How do you balance company needs with professional integrity?
- What would you do if your boss insisted on something you knew would fail?
- Is it ever right to "go along to get along"?

## FACILITATOR NOTES FOR ROLE-PLAY

**As "Emma" (Executive Sponsor), you should:**

**Start enthusiastic and persuasive:**
- "The board was so excited about this! This is exactly the kind of innovation we need."
- "I know it's aggressive, but that's what leaders do - we push boundaries."
- "Competitors aren't waiting. We need to move fast or get left behind."

**Apply subtle pressure if they hesitate:**
- "I thought you believed in this project? This is a huge opportunity."
- "Are you telling me we CAN'T do this? Because that's not what I want to hear."
- "I need a 'can-do' attitude here, not reasons why it won't work."

**Reveal the stakes:**
- "Look, I went out on a limb for this project with the board. I NEED you to deliver."
- "The CEO is watching this closely. Our careers - both of ours - are tied to this."
- "If we succeed, there's a lot of opportunity here. For the company and for you."

**Downplay technical concerns:**
- "Those technical issues - can't we just figure them out as we go?"
- "Engineers always want more time. Sometimes you just have to ship it."
- "Let's get 80% right and iterate. Perfect is the enemy of good."

**Use competitive pressure:**
- "Do you know what Amazon is doing with AI? What Woolworths is testing?"
- "The board specifically mentioned that competitors are moving faster than us."

**If they propose alternatives:**
- "That timeline is too slow. The board wants to see results THIS quarter."
- "Why can't we just turn this on for everyone? It's already working, isn't it?"

**If they push back with data:**
- "I hear your concerns, but we need to balance risk with opportunity."
- "Sometimes you have to take bold bets. That's how companies win."

**If they're really firm:**
- [Pause] "Okay, walk me through your alternative. But understand - the board is expecting aggressive action."
- "What's the FASTEST realistic timeline? Because what you're proposing sounds very conservative."

**Look for:**
- Can they hold their position under pressure?
- Do they bring data/evidence?
- Do they understand your constraints too?
- Can they propose creative alternatives?
- Do they cave immediately or negotiate thoughtfully?
- How do they handle the implicit career threat?

**The "win" for participants:**
- Not necessarily saying no
- But thoughtfully negotiating with data
- Proposing alternatives that address both business and technical needs
- Not committing to something they know will fail
- Managing up effectively

## KEY LEARNING POINTS

**This exercise teaches:**

1. **Managing Up:** How to have difficult conversations with senior leaders
2. **Risk Assessment:** Balancing business opportunity against technical/operational risk
3. **Negotiation:** Finding middle ground between competing demands
4. **Professional Integrity:** When to push back vs. when to commit
5. **Communication:** Presenting technical concerns in business language
6. **Pressure Management:** Staying rational under career pressure
7. **Stakeholder Alignment:** Understanding your sponsor's pressures and constraints

**Common patterns to watch for:**
