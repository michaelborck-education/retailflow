## GROUP DISCUSSION ACTIVITY (15 minutes)

Work with your table group to complete the stakeholder mapping exercise:

### Stakeholder Influence vs. Interest Matrix

Plot each stakeholder on this matrix:

```
        HIGH INFLUENCE
              |
              |
    KEEP      |      MANAGE
  SATISFIED   |      CLOSELY
              |
--------------+-------------- HIGH INTEREST
              |
   MONITOR    |    KEEP
              |   INFORMED
              |
        LOW INFLUENCE
```

**For each stakeholder, determine:**

| Stakeholder | Influence Level (H/M/L) | Interest Level (H/M/L) | Quadrant | Engagement Strategy |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|----------|---------------------|
| Data Scientist | | | | |
| Operations Manager | | | | |
