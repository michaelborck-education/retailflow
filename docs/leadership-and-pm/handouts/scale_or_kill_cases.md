# CASE STUDY A: THE CLEAR SUCCESS
## AI Inventory Prediction System - Fashion Retailer

---

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Company:** StyleMart - Mid-sized fashion retailer (35 stores)

**The Problem:**  
StyleMart was losing money on both ends of inventory management:
- Stockouts (lost sales when popular items sold out)
- Overstock (heavy markdowns on items that didn't sell)

**The Solution:**  
AI system that predicts demand for clothing items by store, using:
- Historical sales data
- Weather patterns
- Local events (concerts, sports, festivals)
- Social media trends
- Competitor pricing

The system automatically adjusts stock orders for each store.

**Timeline:** 12-month pilot across 10 of 35 stores

---

---

### RESULTS AFTER 12 MONTHS

#### Inventory Performance Metrics:

| Metric | Before AI | After AI | Change |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Stock-out rate | 45% | 12% | ↓ 73% |
| Overstock rate | 31% | 9% | ↓ 71% |
| Inventory turnover ratio | 4.2x per year | 6.8x per year | ↑ 62% |
| Waste from unsold seasonal items | $420K | $176K | ↓ 58% |

#### Financial Impact:

| Impact Area | Annual Value |
|------------|--------------|
| Revenue increase (fewer stockouts) | +$1,200,000 |
| Cost savings (reduced overstock) | +$800,000 |
| **Total Annual Benefit** | **$2,000,000** |
| **ROI (First Year)** | **733%** |

#### Operational Improvements:

- **Ordering process time:** Reduced by 70% (from 8 hours/week to 2.5 hours/week per store manager)
- **Merchandising team:** Freed up 15 hours/week to focus on strategy vs. manual forecasting
- **Planning accuracy:** Improved from 62% to 87%

---

### STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK

**Store Managers (8 of 10 positive):**
> "Finally! We get the right products at the right time. I'm not constantly calling head office asking for stock transfers." - Manager, Bondi Store

> "First month was rough - the AI made some weird predictions. But after it learned our store's patterns, it's been amazing." - Manager, Perth Store

**Two skeptics initially:**
> "I didn't trust it for the first 3 months. Kept overriding its recommendations. Then I realized my gut instinct was wrong more often than the AI." - Manager, Melbourne Store (now biggest advocate)

**Merchandising Team:**
> "This has transformed how we work. We're now analyzing trends and planning strategy instead of drowning in spreadsheets." - Head of Merchandising

**CFO:**
> "The ROI is undeniable. This is exactly the kind of AI investment that makes sense."

**Customers:**
- Customer satisfaction: +14% (products in stock when they want them)
- Net Promoter Score: +8 points
- Fewer complaints about "never having my size"

---

### TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE

- **Prediction accuracy:** 87% (vs. 62% with old manual forecasting)
- **System uptime:** 99.7%
- **Integration:** Seamless with existing ERP and POS systems
- **Maintenance:** 2 hours/month (mostly automated)

---

### CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED

**Month 1-2:**
- Accuracy was only 68% (AI was learning store-specific patterns)
- Store managers didn't trust it, kept overriding recommendations
- One store had a stock disaster (AI didn't account for local road closure during festival)

**Month 3:**
- One store manager resisted for 3 months ("I know my customers better than a computer")
- Eventually came around after seeing results at other stores

**Month 7:**
- IT needed to upgrade server capacity - unexpected $12,000 cost

**By Month 9:**
- All issues resolved, system performing consistently

---

### CURRENT STATUS

- **All 10 pilot stores** enthusiastically want to keep it
- **15 other stores** have formally requested access
- **Merchandising VP** champions it in every executive meeting
- **Store managers** sharing success stories internally

**Team Recommendation:** Scale to all 35 stores immediately

# CASE STUDY B: THE CLEAR FAILURE
## AI Staff Scheduling System - Restaurant Chain

---

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Company:** CasualBite - Fast-casual restaurant chain (24 locations)

**The Problem:**
- Labor costs were 28% of revenue (target: 26%)
- Inefficient scheduling (overstaffed at slow times, understaffed during rushes)
- Manual scheduling took managers 6 hours/week

**The Solution:**
AI creates optimal staff schedules based on predicted customer traffic, considering:
- Historical traffic patterns
- Weather forecasts
- Local events
- Holidays and school calendars
- Staff availability and preferences

**Goal:** Reduce labor costs while maintaining (or improving) service quality

**Timeline:** 6-month pilot across 8 restaurants

---

### INVESTMENT

| Category | Amount |
|----------|---------|
| Software License (Annual) | $95,000 |
| Implementation & Integration | $60,000 |
| Training | $25,000 |
| **Total Investment** | **$180,000** |

---

### RESULTS AFTER 6 MONTHS

#### Labor Metrics:

| Metric | Before AI | After AI | Change |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Labor cost as % of revenue | 28% | 26% | ↓ 2% ✅ |
| Total staff hours per week (all 8 locations) | 2,840 hours | 2,520 hours | ↓ 11% |
| **Achieved cost savings goal!** | | | **Met target** |

**Looks successful, right? But...**

---

#### Service Impact:

| Metric | Before AI | After AI | Change |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Average customer wait time | 8 minutes | 18 minutes | ↑ 125% ❌ |
| Customer complaints (per month) | 23 | 78 | ↑ 340% ❌ |
| Table turnover rate | 2.8 turns/table/dinner | 2.2 turns/table/dinner | ↓ 22% ❌ |
| Customer satisfaction score | 82% | 61% | ↓ 21 points ❌ |
| Walkouts (customers who left before being served) | ~2 per week | ~8 per week | ↑ 400% ❌ |

---

#### Staff Impact:

| Metric | Before AI | After AI | Change |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Employee turnover (annual rate) | 23% | 67% | ↑ 191% ❌ |
| Staff satisfaction survey | 68% | 31% | ↓ 37 points ❌ |
| Shifts scheduled with <24hrs notice | 12/month | 54/month | ↑ 450% ❌ |
| "Split shifts" assigned | 8/month | 30/month | ↑ 275% ❌ |
| Staff calling in sick (suspected protest) | 4% of shifts | 11% of shifts | ↑ 175% ❌ |

---

### WHAT WENT WRONG

**The AI optimized for the wrong objective.**

It successfully minimized labor costs, but in doing so, it created:

#### 1. Unpredictable Schedules
- Staff received schedules with <24 hours notice
- Shifts changed frequently based on AI weather predictions
- Impossible for staff to plan childcare, second jobs, or personal lives
- Example: "You're scheduled Thursday 11am-2pm... wait, now you're off Thursday and working Friday instead."

#### 2. Chronic Understaffing
- AI predicted lower traffic than actually occurred
- Scheduled minimum staff "just in case" traffic was low
- When restaurants got busy, staff were overwhelmed
- No buffer for unexpected rushes

#### 3. Split Shifts
- AI assigned shifts like: Work 11am-2pm (lunch), then come back 6pm-9pm (dinner)
- Saves labor cost (don't pay for 2-6pm gap)
- Staff hated having to come in twice with unpaid gap in between

#### 4. Zero Consideration for Employee Wellbeing
- Algorithm saw staff as interchangeable units
- No consideration for preferences, fairness, or morale
- Optimized for cost, ignored human factors

---

### REAL EXAMPLES

**Example 1: The Saturday Disaster**
- AI predicted low traffic for Saturday dinner (based on weather forecast of rain)
- Scheduled only 3 servers and 2 kitchen staff
- Weather cleared up, restaurant got slammed
- 45-minute wait times, terrible service, 12 groups walked out
- Saved $240 in labor that night, lost ~$1,800 in revenue
- Two servers quit the next week from stress

**Example 2: The Single Mom**
- Server with consistent childcare needs (needed 9am-5pm shifts)
- AI started scheduling her for split shifts and evening close
- She couldn't find childcare, had to quit
- Lost a 4-year employee with excellent reviews

**Example 3: The Text Message**
- Staff member received text at 8pm: "Your shift tomorrow has been cancelled due to predicted low traffic"
- Had already arranged childcare and turned down other work
- Lost a day's wages with 14 hours notice

---

### FINANCIAL REALITY CHECK

**What the CFO saw initially:**
- Labor cost savings: $84,000 over 6 months ✅

**What the full picture shows:**
- Labor savings: +$84,000
- Revenue loss (slower table turns, walkouts, bad reviews): -$127,000
- Recruiting & training costs (67% turnover): -$93,000
- Brand damage (one-star reviews): -$45,000 (estimated)
- **Net Financial Impact: -$181,000 LOSS** ❌

---

### STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK

**Restaurant Managers (7 of 8 want it gone):**
> "This system is destroying my team. I'm losing good people who've been with us for years because they can't plan their lives." - Manager, Brisbane Location

> "We're saving money on labor but hemorrhaging revenue because service is terrible. This is penny-wise, pound-foolish." - Manager, Sydney Location

> "I've gone back to manual scheduling. I'd rather spend 6 hours a week on schedules than deal with this mess." - Manager, Melbourne Location (already stopped using the AI)

**Staff (via anonymous survey):**
> "I have two jobs. I can't work when the AI changes my schedule with 12 hours notice. I'm looking for a new job." 

> "I used to love working here. Now I dread checking my phone to see what crazy schedule the computer made."

> "The AI treats us like robots. Management clearly doesn't care about us anymore."

**District Manager:**
> "We're saving on labor costs but losing customers. We've dropped from 4.2 stars to 2.8 stars on Google. Not worth it."

**HR Director:**
> "We're hemorrhaging talent. Exit interviews all mention the scheduling system. It's going to cost us more to rebuild the team than we saved."

**Customers (Online Reviews):**
> "Used to be my favorite restaurant. Now there's never enough staff. 30-minute wait for fast-casual food? No thanks."

> "You can tell the staff are stressed and understaffed. Not their fault, but I won't be back."

---

### TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE

**Ironically, the AI worked perfectly:**
- Algorithm functioned as designed ✅
- Minimized labor costs ✅
- System uptime: 98% ✅
- Integration with scheduling software: Flawless ✅
- Predictions were actually quite accurate ✅

**The problem:** It was optimized for the wrong goal.

The AI did exactly what it was told to do (minimize labor cost). It just ignored all the human and business consequences.

---

### CURRENT STATUS

- **6 of 8 restaurants** have formally requested to stop using it
- **2 managers** already reverted to manual scheduling (without approval)
- **Multiple formal HR complaints** filed
- **3 threatened lawsuits** from employees (unfair scheduling practices)
- **Union is getting involved** (in locations where staff are unionized)
- **Customer satisfaction declining** at all pilot locations
- **Google/Yelp ratings down** an average of 1.4 stars

**Team Recommendation:** Kill the project immediately

---

## YOUR ANALYSIS

**Decision:** ☐ SCALE  ☐ PIVOT  ☐ KILL

---

### If KILL:

**What's the key lesson learned?**

&nbsp;

**What would you do differently if you tried this again?**

&nbsp;

**How do you communicate this to stakeholders?**

&nbsp;

---

### If PIVOT:

**What would you change about the approach?**

&nbsp;

**Would changing the optimization criteria fix this?**

For example, what if AI optimized for:
- Minimize labor cost AND maintain customer satisfaction >80%
- Minimize labor cost AND maintain staff satisfaction >70%
- Minimize labor cost AND limit schedule changes to 72hrs notice

**Would that address the core issues?**

&nbsp;

**Is this worth pivoting or is the concept fundamentally flawed?**

&nbsp;

---

### If SCALE:

**Why would you scale this?**

**What are you seeing that the restaurants aren't?**

---

### Reflection Questions:

**What does this case teach about:**
- Choosing the right success metrics?
- AI ethics and human impact?
- The difference between "working as designed" and "working well"?

# CASE STUDY C: THE AMBIGUOUS ONE
## AI Dynamic Pricing System - E-Commerce Platform

---

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

**Company:** HomeGoods Online - E-commerce retailer (home goods, furniture, decor)

**The Problem:**
- Competitive pricing pressure
- Inventory sitting too long (carrying costs)
- Revenue optimization opportunities being missed
- Manual pricing decisions slow and inconsistent

**The Solution:**
AI adjusts product prices in real-time based on:
- Demand signals (page views, cart additions, search volume)
- Competitor pricing (monitoring 12 major competitors)
- Inventory levels (reduce prices on slow-moving stock)
- Time of day, day of week patterns
- Customer browsing behavior (how long they looked, how many times they returned)

Prices can fluctuate throughout the day, similar to airline pricing.

**Timeline:** 9-month pilot on 500 products (out of 12,000 total catalog)

---

**From a pure financial perspective: This is working.**

---

### BUT... CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE METRICS:

| Metric | Before AI | After AI | Change |
|--------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Customer complaints about pricing | 8/month | 27/month | ↑ 340% ❌ |
| Negative social media mentions | 12/month | 62/month | ↑ 520% ❌ |
| Cart abandonment rate | 58% | 71% | ↑ 13 points ❌ |
| Customer satisfaction score | 79% | 67% | ↓ 12 points ❌ |
| Return rate | 12% | 18% | ↑ 50% ❌ |
| "Price complaint" customer service tickets | 45/month | 178/month | ↑ 396% ❌ |

**From a customer experience perspective: This is causing problems.**

---

### WHAT'S HAPPENING - REAL SCENARIOS

#### Scenario 1: The "Price Watcher" 

**Monday 10am:**
- Customer browses decorative lamp, price is $89.99
- Adds to cart but doesn't purchase
- Leaves website

**Monday 2pm:**
- Customer returns to complete purchase
- Price is now $107.99 (+20%)
- AI detected high interest, raised price
- Customer feels manipulated, abandons cart
- Posts on social media: "They're tracking me and punishing me for looking!"

**Result:** Lost sale + bad publicity

---

#### Scenario 2: The "Bad Luck Shopper"

**Customer A - Monday morning:**
- Buys throw pillows: $79.99
- Happy with purchase

**Customer B (Customer A's friend) - Tuesday afternoon:**
- Buys identical throw pillows: $64.99
- Posts on Instagram about the "great deal"

**Customer A sees friend's post:**
- Realizes they paid $15 more for identical product 24 hours earlier
- Feels ripped off, demands price match
- Returns item, writes negative review
- Posts complaint: "They charge different prices to different people!"

**Result:** Lost customer loyalty + negative word of mouth

---

#### Scenario 3: The "Social Media Firestorm"

**Customer tweets:**
> "I've been watching this coffee table for a week. Price changes EVERY TIME I look at it. $245 → $289 → $227 → $312. Are they tracking me?? This feels predatory. @HomeGoodsOnline"

**Tweet goes viral** (12,000 retweets)

**Media picks it up:**
> "HomeGoods Online Uses AI to Track Shoppers and Manipulate Prices"

**Reality:** AI adjusts by time/demand, NOT by individual customer. But perception = reality.

---

#### Scenario 4: The "Algorithm Winner"

**Thursday 2am:**
- Item usually $150
- AI detects very low demand overnight
- Reduces price to $112 to test price elasticity

**Customer finds it:**
- Thrilled with deal, buys 3 units
- Tells 5 friends about amazing price

**Friends check 6 hours later:**
- Price back to $145
- All 5 friends feel deceived
- Brand looks inconsistent and untrustworthy

---

### CUSTOMER FEEDBACK (QUALITATIVE)

#### Positive Comments (15% of feedback):
> "I got an amazing deal on exactly what I needed!"

> "Prices seem to drop when items aren't selling well - good for bargain hunters"

#### Negative Comments (85% of feedback):

**Theme 1: Feeling Tracked (43% of complaints)**
> "It's creepy that prices change when I look at products"

> "This is predatory pricing - they're tracking my behavior"

> "I feel manipulated, like they know I really want it so they raise the price"

**Theme 2: Inconsistency/Unfairness (31% of complaints)**
> "Prices change every time I look - I can't trust them"

> "My friend paid less for the same thing - that's not fair"

> "How can the price go up $40 in 3 hours?"

**Theme 3: Trust Erosion (28% of complaints)**
> "I used to love this store but now I feel like they're trying to scam me"

> "Can't trust a company that changes prices randomly"

> "This has destroyed my loyalty to this brand"

---

### MEDIA ATTENTION

**Local news story:**
> "Perth-based HomeGoods Online Uses AI to Charge Different Customers Different Prices"

**The article was technically inaccurate** (AI adjusts by time/demand, not by individual customer) but:
- Damage to brand perception was real
- 47,000 views on the news website
- Shared widely on social media
- Comments section filled with anger

**Company response was defensive:**
> "Our dynamic pricing is similar to airlines and ride-sharing services"

**Public reaction:**
> "Yeah, and we hate that too!"

---

### INTERNAL STAKEHOLDER VIEWS

**CFO (Pro-Scaling):**
> "Revenue is up 8.2%. Margin is up 3.1%. ROI is 138%. This is working. We need to scale this to all 12,000 products immediately. Customer complaints are just noise - people always complain. Look at the data."

**CMO (Anti-Scaling):**
> "Customer satisfaction is down 12 points. That's catastrophic for long-term brand value. We're destroying trust for short-term revenue gains. Customer lifetime value is more important than this quarter's revenue. This is incredibly short-sighted."

**Head of E-commerce (Conflicted):**
> "The data shows it's working from a revenue perspective. But the customer feedback is genuinely concerning. I worry we're winning battles and losing the war. Maybe we're just not communicating it well?"

**Customer Service Director (Strongly Against):**
> "My team is drowning in pricing complaints. This has created a massive operational burden. Customers are angry, confused, and feel cheated. Whatever revenue we're gaining, we're paying for it in customer service costs and brand damage."

**Data Scientist (Neutral/Technical):**
> "The algorithm is performing exactly as designed. It's optimizing for revenue. If the business wants to optimize for something else - like customer satisfaction or price stability - we can adjust the model. But right now it's doing what it was asked to do."

**CEO (Waiting for Recommendation):**
> "I need a clear recommendation from this group. Is this good for RetailFlow long-term? I don't care about this quarter - I care about the next 3 years. Make a recommendation you can defend."

---

### TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE

- **Algorithm works perfectly:** Sophisticated, well-designed
- **Revenue optimization:** Achieving its goal
- **System uptime:** 99.2%
- **Pricing adjustments:** Smooth, accurate, responsive
- **No technical failures**

**The question isn't whether it works technically. The question is whether it's the right thing to do.**

---

### MARKET CONTEXT

**What competitors are doing:**

- **Amazon:** Uses dynamic pricing extensively (hundreds of price changes per day on some items)
- **Airlines:** Dynamic pricing standard practice
- **Uber/Lyft:** Surge pricing well-established
- **Many retailers:** Moving toward dynamic pricing

**BUT:**

Some competitors are going the opposite direction:
- **Everlane:** Markets "transparent pricing" and "no sales" as competitive advantage
- **Costco:** Stable pricing as brand promise
- **Some boutique brands:** "Honest pricing, no games" positioning

**Regulatory environment:**
- Australian Consumer Law: No explicit prohibition on dynamic pricing
- Growing scrutiny: Politicians discussing regulations
- EU: Considering transparency requirements
- Consumer advocacy groups: Calling dynamic pricing "exploitative"

---

### THE DILEMMA

✅ **Financially successful:** 8.2% revenue increase, positive ROI, meeting business objectives

❌ **Customer experience suffering:** 12-point satisfaction drop, trust erosion, negative sentiment

❓ **Long-term impact unclear:**
- Will revenue gains sustain if brand trust continues to erode?
- Are we winning revenue today but losing loyalty tomorrow?
- Is 8% revenue gain worth 12-point satisfaction drop?
- What happens when competitors do the same thing?

---

### CURRENT STATUS

- **Finance wants to SCALE:** "The numbers are great"
- **Marketing wants to KILL:** "We're destroying the brand"
- **E-commerce is CONFLICTED:** "It's working but I'm worried"
- **Customer service wants to KILL:** "This is creating chaos"
- **CEO wants YOUR recommendation**

**Team Recommendation:** ???

---

## YOUR ANALYSIS (This is the hard one)

**Decision:** ☐ SCALE  ☐ PIVOT  ☐ KILL

&nbsp;

**What guardrails will you put in place?**

&nbsp;

**How will you communicate this to customers?**

&nbsp;

**Success metrics for the scaled version:**

&nbsp;

---

### IF PIVOT:

**What specific changes would you make?**

Examples to consider:
- Limit price fluctuation to ±15%?
- Only adjust prices once daily, not throughout day?
- Show customers historical pricing?
- Grandfather previous prices for returning customers?
- Opt-in "price watch" notifications?

**Your pivot approach:**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Would this pivot address the core issues?**

&nbsp;

---

### IF KILL:

**How do you justify killing a project with positive ROI?**

&nbsp;

**What's more important than short-term revenue?**

&nbsp;

**How do you respond to the CFO who wants to scale?**

&nbsp;

---

### DEFENDING YOUR DECISION

**How will you defend this to:**

**The CFO (who sees 8.2% revenue increase):**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**The CMO (who sees 12-point satisfaction drop):**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**The CEO (who wants long-term brand value):**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Customers (if they ask about your pricing):**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

---

### THE HARD QUESTIONS

**Is dynamic pricing inherently unethical?**
- Amazon does it
- Airlines do it
- Is it different when AI does it vs. humans?

&nbsp;

**What's the difference between "smart pricing" and "price manipulation"?**

&nbsp;

**How do you balance:**
- Shareholder value (maximize revenue)
- Customer trust (stable, fair pricing)
- Competitive necessity (others are doing this)

&nbsp;

**If you kill this, are you leaving money on the table?**

&nbsp;

**If you scale this, are you sacrificing long-term brand for short-term gains?**

&nbsp;

---

## REFLECTION

**What makes this case different from Cases A and B?**

&nbsp;

**What decision framework did you use?**

&nbsp;

**How did your group handle disagreement?**

&nbsp;

**Are you comfortable defending your decision publicly?**

&nbsp;

---

## FACILITATOR DEBRIEF POINTS

**This case deliberately has no clear "right" answer.**

**Strong responses will:**
- Acknowledge the tension between financial and experiential metrics
- Consider long-term vs. short-term impacts
- Think about brand positioning and values
- Consider competitive context
- Make a clear decision with sound reasoning

**Watch for:**
- Groups that only look at financial metrics
- Groups that ignore the positive ROI
- Groups that can't make a decision
- Groups that find creative middle ground

**Key discussion:**
- How many groups chose differently?
- What values/priorities drove different decisions?
- Is there a "right" answer?
- What would change your mind?
