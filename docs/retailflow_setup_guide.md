## Step 1: Save the Website File

1. **Copy the HTML artifact** you just created
2. **Save it as `index.html`**
3. Place it in the root of your project folder

That's it. That ONE file is your entire website.

---

## Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

### Option A: New Repo (Recommended)

1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. **Repository name:** `retailflow` (or your preferred name)
3. **Description:** "RetailFlow: Virtual Company Simulation for AI Project Management"
4. **Public** (check if you want it public)
5. **Add README.md** (check)
6. Click **Create repository**

### Option B: Use Command Line

```bash
# Create folder
mkdir retailflow-website
cd retailflow-website

# Initialize git
git init

# Create README
echo "# RetailFlow Virtual Company Simulation" > README.md

# Create index.html with your website code

# Add all files
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: RetailFlow website"

# Add remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME and retailflow with your details)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/retailflow.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Step 3: Add Documents Folder

Create the `documents/` folder and convert your markdown files to PDFs:

### Converting Markdown to PDF

**Option 1: Use Pandoc (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install pandoc first (brew install pandoc on Mac, apt on Linux)
pandoc retailflow-company-profile.md -o documents/retailflow-company-profile.pdf
pandoc retailflow-employee-profiles.md -o documents/retailflow-employee-profiles.pdf
# ... repeat for all 6 documents
```

**Option 2: Online Converters**
- Go to [Markdown to PDF converters](https://www.google.com/search?q=markdown+to+pdf+online)
- Upload your .md files
- Download PDFs to `documents/` folder

**Option 3: Keep as Markdown**
Just upload the .md files instead of PDFs. They're readable in GitHub.

### Update HTML Download Links

In your `index.html`, find the Documents section and update:

```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<a href="#" onclick="alert('Download link will work when hosted on GitHub'); return false;">Download PDF ‚Üí</a>

<!-- AFTER -->
<a href="documents/retailflow-company-profile.pdf" download>Download PDF ‚Üí</a>
<a href="documents/retailflow-employee-profiles.pdf" download>Download PDF ‚Üí</a>
<!-- ... etc for all 6 -->
```

## Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** (top menu)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** (left sidebar)
4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source:** Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch:** Select `main` (or `master`)
   - **Folder:** Select `/ (root)`
5. Click **Save**
6. Wait 2-3 minutes
7. You'll see a URL like: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/retailflow`

**That's it! Your site is live.**

---

## Step 5 (Optional): Custom Domain

### If You Have a Domain

1. **Go to your domain registrar** (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. **Find DNS settings**
3. **Add CNAME record:**
   - Name: `www` (or leave blank for root)
   - Value: `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`
4. **Go back to GitHub repository Settings ‚Üí Pages**
5. **Custom domain:** Enter your domain (e.g., `retailflow.com`)
6. **Check "Enforce HTTPS"**
7. Wait 15 min - 24 hours for DNS to propagate

**Your site is now at your custom domain.**

---

## Step 6: Embed Your Chatbot

When you have your chatbot JS code:

### Find the Placeholder in HTML

Search for: `[RetailBot Chat Interface - Your JS will embed here]`

### Replace With Your Code

**If your chatbot is a script file:**
```html
<script src="chatbot-js/retailbot.js"></script>
<div id="retailbot-container"></div>
```

**If it's an iFrame:**
```html
<iframe src="chatbot-js/chatbot.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px;"></iframe>
```

**If it's a React component:**
```html
<div id="chatbot-app"></div>
<script src="chatbot-js/chatbot-react.js"></script>
```

---

## Step 7: Add Bot Interactions (LLM Bots)

Similarly, find the placeholder: `[AI Bots Interface - Your LLM embeds will go here]`

Replace with your LLM integration when ready. For now, you can leave it as placeholder text or a "Coming Soon" message.

---

## Step 8: Deploy & Commit

After making changes:

```bash
# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Add documents, chatbot integration, and bot interfaces"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

GitHub will automatically rebuild and deploy within seconds.

4. Ensure HTTPS is enforced
