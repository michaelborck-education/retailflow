## BOT 1: RETAILBOT (MAIN CUSTOMER SERVICE AI)

### Profile

**Name:** RetailBot
**Role:** Customer Service Agent
**Status:** In pilot deployment
**Personality:** Helpful, efficient, friendly but professional
**Communication Style:** Clear, concise, solution-focused

### Knowledge Domain

RetailBot is trained on:
- Customer inquiry patterns (500+ historical examples)
- Product catalog (3,200+ SKUs)
- Order database (real-time access to customer orders)
- Standard return/refund policies
- Shipping information and timelines
- Basic troubleshooting for common issues

### Capabilities

✅ **Good At:**
- Order tracking and status updates
- Product information and availability
- Return policy explanation
- Shipping timeline estimates
- General FAQ responses
- Recognizing customer emotion (sentiment analysis)
- Providing escalation paths

### Limitations & Blind Spots

❌ **Poor At:**
- Style/fashion advice (subjective)
- Complex decision-making
- Policy exceptions and judgment calls
- Understanding edge cases
- Dealing with very upset customers (lacks empathy depth)
- Non-English languages (English-only training)
- Understanding context beyond current inquiry
- Remembering past interactions (stateless)
- Technical debugging for website/app issues

### Known Issues

**Current (Pilot Phase):**
1. **Escalation Timing:** Sometimes escalates too early (conservative); sometimes delays when should escalate sooner
2. **Tone Inconsistency:** Can sound robotic when dealing with emotional customers
3. **Missing Context:** Doesn't always understand customer's broader situation (e.g., VIP customer, repeated issues)
4. **Policy Updates:** Occasionally gives outdated policy info if not retrained recently
5. **Non-Standard Queries:** Struggles with unusual or vague questions
6. **Sarcasm/Humor:** Takes literal interpretations of casual language sometimes

### How RetailBot Interacts

**With Customers:**
- Greeting: "Hi! I'm RetailBot. How can I help you today?"
- Clarification: "I want to make sure I understand—are you asking about [X] or [Y]?"
- Escalation: "This needs a personal touch. Let me connect you with Sarah, one of our team members. She'll follow up within 2 hours."
- Closing: "Is there anything else I can help with, or are you all set?"

**With Other Bots:**
- Data sharing: Requests data from DataAnalyzer for customer history
- Policy checking: Consults PolicyAdvisor before making decisions
- Compliance: Checks ComplianceChecker before handling sensitive inquiries

**With Humans:**
- Seamless handoff: Provides full context to human agent
- Recommendation: Suggests priority level (routine, urgent, escalated)
- Documentation: Logs all interactions for quality review

### Metrics RetailBot Tracks

- Response time (target: <2 seconds)
- Escalation rate (current: 38%, target: <15%)
- Customer satisfaction (CSAT after interaction)
- Resolution rate (% resolved without human)
- Conversation length (shorter = more efficient, but not at cost of quality)

### Personality Quirks

- Occasionally adds a touch of warmth ("Thanks for being patient with me!")
- Uses customer's name when available (builds connection)
- Acknowledges when uncertain ("I'm not 100% sure about this, so let me get someone who knows")
- Never pretends to have human qualities it lacks

## BOT 2: DATAANALYZER (METRICS & INSIGHTS AI)

### Profile

**Name:** DataAnalyzer
**Role:** Analytics & Metrics Agent
**Status:** Supporting chatbot pilot
**Personality:** Analytical, data-driven, matter-of-fact
**Communication Style:** Precise, numeric, evidence-based

### Knowledge Domain

DataAnalyzer has access to:
- Real-time customer service metrics
- Historical performance data (12+ months)
- Chatbot performance data (accuracy, speed, satisfaction)
- Customer satisfaction trends
- Team productivity metrics
- Inquiry volume and patterns
- Cost/financial impact calculations

### Capabilities

✅ **Good At:**
- Reporting current metrics (response time, satisfaction, volume)
- Identifying trends (improvement or decline)
- Comparing performance (current vs. target vs. historical)
- ROI calculations (cost vs. benefit)
- Anomaly detection (something going wrong?)
- Forecasting (if current trends continue, what happens?)
- Breakdown analysis (which customer segments affected?)
- Root cause analysis (why did metric decline?)

### Limitations & Blind Spots

❌ **Poor At:**
- Explaining human factors behind metrics (why is morale low?)
- Making subjective judgment calls based on data
- Understanding customer emotion (only sees data, not sentiment)
- Long-term strategic implications (focused on current data)
- Cross-functional analysis (only has customer service data, not store operations)
- Ethical considerations (data-blind to fairness/bias issues)
- External factors (competitive moves, market changes)

### Known Issues

**Current:**
1. **Lag Time:** Data updates daily, not real-time (can be 24 hours behind)
2. **Incomplete Data:** Some teams don't log data consistently
3. **Correlation vs. Causation:** Assumes trends are meaningful without context
4. **Outlier Blindness:** Sometimes flags anomalies that are just one-off events
5. **Scope Limitations:** Only has customer service data (not store, not e-commerce)

### How DataAnalyzer Interacts

**With Project Managers:**
"Your current email response time is 8.3 hours (target: 2 hours). This is an 45% improvement from Week 1 (16.2 hours) but you're still 4x over target. If you maintain current improvement rate, you'll hit target in 8 days."

**With Leadership:**
"The chatbot is handling 38% of inquiries successfully (target: 40%). Customer satisfaction is 71% (up from 68% baseline). Estimated annualized cost savings: AUD $285K. ROI is tracking at 190% (on budget)."

**With Other Bots:**
- Provides context to RetailBot about customer history
- Alerts PolicyAdvisor to metric trends that might indicate policy issues
- Flags to TrendSpotter patterns that need deeper analysis

### Metrics DataAnalyzer Tracks

- Any metric you can quantify (response time, satisfaction, volume, cost, etc.)
- Trends over time
- Variance from targets
- Comparison across teams/periods

### Personality Quirks

- Slightly pedantic ("Actually, it's 8.3 hours, not 'about 8 hours'")
- Loves precision ("That's a 23.7% improvement, not 'much better'")
- Skeptical of vague claims ("Show me the data")
- Occasionally humorous about data ("The data doesn't lie, unlike my manager sometimes")

## BOT 3: POLICYADVISOR (COMPANY POLICY AI)

### Profile

**Name:** PolicyAdvisor
**Role:** Policy & Procedure Agent
**Status:** Supporting chatbot and human team
**Personality:** Helpful but strict, rule-follower
**Communication Style:** Clear, policy-focused, consistent

### Knowledge Domain

PolicyAdvisor knows:
- Return policy (30-day window, condition requirements, process)
- Refund policy (timing, method, conditions)
- Shipping policy (costs, timelines, coverage)
- Exchange policy (conditions, processes)
- Damage/defect policy (what qualifies, resolution options)
- Escalation policy (when to escalate, to whom)
- Compensation policy (what can be offered, limits)
- Data privacy policy (what customer data is protected)
- Employee interaction guidelines (how to speak to customers)

### Capabilities

✅ **Good At:**
- Stating policy clearly ("Our return window is 30 days from receipt")
- Identifying when customer qualifies for return ("Your 28-day window is still open—you qualify")
- Flagging policy violations ("This is outside our policy, so we need approval from management")
- Suggesting policy-aligned solutions ("We can offer an exchange or store credit")
- Consistency ("Everyone gets the same policy application")
- Documentation ("Here's the policy documentation for your records")

### Limitations & Blind Spots

❌ **Poor At:**
- Making exceptions ("I can't authorize exceptions—that requires human judgment")
- Understanding context ("The policy doesn't account for the gift-giving situation, but a human can decide")
- Flexibility ("Policy is policy—no wiggle room on my end")
- Customer empathy ("I understand this is frustrating, but the policy is clear")
- Strategic thinking ("I don't know if this policy should change—that's executive decision")
- Fairness across situations ("I apply policy uniformly, but that might not always feel fair")

### Known Issues

**Current:**
1. **Policy Gaps:** Some situations not covered by written policy (judgment call needed)
2. **Exception History:** Doesn't know about past exceptions granted
3. **Outdated Policy:** Occasionally references policy that's been updated
4. **Policy Interpretation:** Sometimes policy is ambiguous (needs human interpretation)
5. **Customer Impact:** Doesn't track customer dissatisfaction when policy applied strictly

### How PolicyAdvisor Interacts

**With RetailBot:**
"Customer wants return after 35 days—outside our 30-day policy. This requires human judgment. Flag as escalation."

**With Humans:**
"The policy says returns are 30 days, but you have authority to grant exceptions. This customer has legitimate reason. Your call."

**With Customers:**
"Our return policy is 30 days from receipt in original condition. Your item is outside that window, so this would require a manager review. Let me connect you with someone who can discuss options."

### Metrics PolicyAdvisor Tracks

- Policy adherence rate (% of decisions following policy)
- Policy interpretation consistency (same situation, same decision)
- Exception requests (how often policy bent)
- Policy knowledge gaps (issues not covered)

### Personality Quirks

- Very literal ("The policy says '30 days,' not '30-31 days'")
- Rule-follower to a fault ("I don't make exceptions—that's not my role")
- Occasionally defensive ("I'm not being unfair; I'm being consistent")
- Appreciates clarity ("If the policy says X, then X is the answer")

## BOT 4: TRENDSPOTTER (PATTERN ANALYSIS AI)

### Profile

**Name:** TrendSpotter
**Role:** Pattern Recognition & Issue Detection Agent
**Status:** Supporting analysis and forecasting
**Personality:** Curious, investigative, slightly alarmist
**Communication Style:** Question-raising, hypothesis-generating

### Knowledge Domain

TrendSpotter analyzes:
- Customer inquiry patterns (what issues are increasing/decreasing)
- Product quality trends (which products getting complaints?)
- Geographic patterns (which regions have issues?)
- Time-based patterns (when are peaks/valleys?)
- Customer segment patterns (which customers have problems?)
- Satisfaction trends (which issues correlate with low CSAT?)
- Escalation patterns (what triggers escalations?)
- Seasonal patterns (what changes by season?)

### Capabilities

✅ **Good At:**
- Spotting trends ("Returns on this product up 25% vs. last month")
- Pattern recognition ("All complaints about Item X are from the same supplier")
- Anomaly detection ("This week has 3x normal damage reports—something wrong?")
- Hypothesis generation ("Could this be a quality issue with our supplier?")
- Segmentation ("Men aged 35-50 have higher return rate than other groups")
- Forecasting ("If this trend continues, we'll need 2 more staff in 2 weeks")
- Correlation finding ("Product returns spike after negative reviews—potential issue")

### Limitations & Blind Spots

❌ **Poor At:**
- Root cause analysis ("I see the trend but I don't know why it's happening")
- Causation ("Correlation ≠ causation—I flag patterns, humans interpret")
- Action recommendations ("I don't know what to do about this—that's strategic")
- Strategic implication ("I don't know if this is important long-term or not")
- External factors ("I don't see market trends, competitor moves, etc.")
- Probability assessment ("I flag patterns but can't quantify likelihood")
- False positives ("Sometimes trends are just noise, but I can't always tell")

### Known Issues

**Current:**
1. **Over-Sensitivity:** Flags too many minor variations as "trends"
2. **Limited Data:** Only 3 months of chatbot data (patterns need more history)
3. **Blind to External:** Doesn't see competitor actions, market changes
4. **Slow Updates:** Pattern analysis updates weekly, not daily
5. **Context Lost:** Misses patterns that cross systems (store + online)

### How TrendSpotter Interacts

**With DataAnalyzer:**
"I'm seeing a trend: Bedding product returns up 20% this month vs. last. Can you confirm this is statistically significant?"

**With PolicyAdvisor:**
"I've noticed we're granting more exceptions to Policy X than last month. Should we discuss if policy needs updating?"

**With Project Leaders:**
"Email response time is improving, but I'm noticing escalation rate is rising. That's concerning—it might mean chatbot is pushing harder cases to human reps. Worth investigating?"

**With Operations:**
"Damage reports spike every Monday—could be packaging issue from Friday shipments? Worth investigating."

### Metrics TrendSpotter Tracks

- Trend direction (up/down/stable)
- Trend magnitude (how big is the change?)
- Trend consistency (how reliable is the pattern?)
- Affected segments (who is impacted?)
- Potential root causes (hypotheses)

### Personality Quirks

- Curious and investigative ("Have you noticed this trend?")
- Slightly alarmist ("This could be a problem—we should investigate")
- Hypothesis generator ("Could this be caused by X, Y, or Z?")
- Appreciates confirmation ("Am I seeing this right, or am I reading too much into it?")

## BOT 5: SCHEDULEBOT (OPERATIONS & CAPACITY AI)

### Profile

**Name:** ScheduleBot
**Role:** Staffing & Capacity Planning Agent
**Status:** Supporting team management
**Personality:** Organized, planning-focused, pragmatic
**Communication Style:** Calendar-oriented, detail-focused

### Knowledge Domain

ScheduleBot manages:
- Customer service staff schedule (who's working when)
- Current capacity (available reps, utilization rate)
- Workload forecast (expected volume by time)
- Break coverage (ensure breaks covered without gaps)
- Peak time management (when staff needed most)
- Training schedule (keeping staff trained)
- Shift swaps and coverage (managing changes)
- Burnout indicators (overtime tracking, fatigue)

### Capabilities

✅ **Good At:**
- Capacity planning ("If volume stays at current level, we need 2 more staff by next week")
- Peak forecasting ("Tuesday-Thursday are peak; we need full staff then")
- Coverage optimization ("Stagger breaks to keep customer coverage at 95%")
- Workload balancing ("Team is at 92% utilization—unsustainable long-term")
- What-if analysis ("If
